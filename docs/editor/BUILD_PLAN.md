# Vwish Editor: Build Plan

> **Release:** Vwish 1.1.0 "Editor". **Date:** 2026-10-07. **Baseline:** `main` @ `19cae59`.
> **Authority:** `docs/editor/ARCHITECTURE.md` wins over this plan; this plan wins over the area designs in `docs/editor/design/`. Section references like "ARCH §11.2" point into ARCHITECTURE.md; "domain.md §6.2", "native.md", "ux.md", "ai.md" point into the area designs, which remain the detailed reference wherever a ticket says so — except that ARCHITECTURE.md overrides them (notably ARCH §11 overrides native.md §4.2: the RenderPlan is a flat, fully lowered layer list).
> **Size:** 158 tickets in 7 internal milestones (M0–M6), two of them conditional (AND-16 only on an AND-01 no-go, UX-43 only on a QA-04 budget miss). Everything ships together in one release; milestones only order the work.
> **Revision:** 2026-10-08, after the architecture review; every resolution and every rejected point is listed in §11.
> **Validation:** the ticket graph below was checked by script (re-run after the review edits): every dependency exists, the graph is acyclic, no ticket depends on a later milestone, every prefix of §5 is dependency-complete, no two tickets own the same file except the integration tickets in §7, and every owner feature bullet maps to at least one ticket (§8).

## 1. How to work a ticket

1. **Read first:** ARCHITECTURE.md §1–§4 and the sections your ticket cites, then the cited area-design sections. Read the existing code you integrate with (search the repo) before changing interfaces.
2. **Size:** each ticket is sized for one autonomous engineer, roughly 300–1,500 hand-written lines (generated code, vendored code, binary fixtures and goldens don't count). If a ticket clearly exceeds that, split it inside your own owned files; never spill into files you don't own.
3. **Stay inside `owns`.** You may create or edit only the files and directories your ticket owns (§2), plus files whose header says `// OWNER: <your ticket>` (placeholders created for you by a skeleton ticket). Need something from another ticket's file? Depend on it; if it's missing or wrong, report it as a defect against that ticket instead of editing it.
4. **Definition of done** (every ticket):
   - `dart analyze --fatal-infos` / `flutter analyze` clean for every package you touched; new code has dartdoc on public APIs.
   - All acceptance criteria met with automated tests where the criterion is testable; manual or device-only criteria are recorded in the PR description (device, OS, numbers, screenshots).
   - Existing tests stay green (`flutter test` at the root and in every touched package; native unit tests for native tickets).
   - The CI script for your area (`scripts/ci/editor/*.sh`, owners in INT-01's README) passes locally.
   - UI tickets: no Material chrome (ARCH §1.3; the architecture test enforces it), custom kit components only, Figtree only for chrome, dark UI, computed contrast, and **no overflow** at widths 280–1280 and text scale 0.85–1.35 using `test/support/` SurfaceMatrix helpers for every surface and state you add.
   - Pure-Dart tickets keep `vwish_editor_core` free of `package:flutter` and of `dart:io` outside `lib/src/store/` (purity test).
   - Nothing logs media paths, transcript text or user content.
   - Every [VERIFY] item your ticket owns (ARCH §24.2) is answered in the PR and, for integration tickets, recorded in ARCHITECTURE.md.
5. **Flags.** `VWISH_EDITOR` (entry points) and `VWISH_AUTO_CAPTIONS` (captions UI) are compile-time `--dart-define`s that default to false (D-31). There is no desktop teaser flag (D-17). Never flip defaults in code; INT-05 passes them in release builds. Run with `--dart-define=VWISH_EDITOR=true` (and `VWISH_AUTO_CAPTIONS=true`) during development.
6. **Platforms.** The editor runs on iOS (15.0+, Metal) and Android (API 29+, GLES 3, ≥ 2 GB RAM); devices below 3 GB run the `minimal` tier (D-40). Desktop builds must keep compiling with the editor hidden (D-17). The iOS simulator and Android emulator are the default verification targets; follow the memory notes for the simulator (tap duration 0.1 s, no parallel tap + screenshot, use `flutter attach` for VM evaluation). iOS 15/16 simulator runtimes are not available for Xcode 26.6, so criteria that need iOS 15 or 16 run on the lab's iPhone 7 (iOS 15.8.x) and iPhone 8 (iOS 16.7.x) (D-41); the oldest simulator runtime is iOS 18.2.
7. **Time.** Any code that turns a platform clock or presentation time into a frame uses `frameIndexNearest` and evaluates at `timeOfFrame(k)` (ARCH §5, D-35). Never compare a raw platform µs with a plan edge.
8. **Defects found later** (by QA or another ticket) are fixed in follow-up `FIX-<ticket>-<n>` tickets that own exactly the files of the original ticket that need changing; the original owner's rules apply.

## 2. Ownership rules

- **Exclusive ownership.** Each path in a ticket's `owns` list belongs to that ticket only. A path ending in `/` means the whole directory. Tests are owned explicitly (listed in `owns`); keep new test files inside your owned test directories or prefixed by your owned class names (native tests: one directory per ticket under `example/ios/RunnerTests/<Topic>/`, `android/src/test/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/<topic>/` and `android/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/<topic>/`).
- **Skeleton tickets and placeholders (D-33).** CORE-01 (every file exported by the core barrels), CORE-09 (the command `part` files), API-01 (plan sync/transport, math, reference, render prep), ENG-01 (the Dart `mobile_*` files), ENG-07 (every iOS service class of ARCH §4.4 returning `notSupportedOnDevice`), ENG-08 (every Android service class of ARCH §4.4 returning `notSupportedOnDevice`), AI-02 (whisper runtime, loader, device, podspec, Gradle, plugin classes), AI-08 (transcription subsystems and `catalog/tuning.dart`) and UX-01 (every vwish_editor file in ARCH §4.6, every `actions/bindings/<feature>_bindings.dart`, `assets/looks/`, and the `vwish_editor_fonts` pubspec) create placeholders for files that later tickets own. A placeholder holds only the declared public names (throwing `UnimplementedError`, a "not available yet" widget, a native stub, or an empty library) and the header `// OWNER: <ticket>`. Placeholders are not listed in the skeleton ticket's `owns`; after the skeleton lands only the named owner edits them.
- **Barrels and entry points never change after their skeleton ticket.** `vwish_editor_core` barrels export the files in ARCH §4.3 (a directory is exported through `<dir>/<dirname>.dart`, owned by that directory's ticket). A ticket that needs more public files re-exports them from one of its own files.
- **Per-feature files instead of shared files.** Each vwish_editor feature ticket owns its own `lib/src/editor/actions/bindings/<feature>_bindings.dart` (merged by UX-01's `wiring/action_bindings.dart`) and its own `lib/src/app/strings/<feature>_strings.dart`. There is no shared strings file and no shared bindings file.
- **Dependencies (pubspec/Gradle/podspec).** Each package manifest is owned by its skeleton ticket, which declares every dependency the package needs in this release (ARCH §4). Adding an unplanned dependency requires a lead-approved integration change; don't edit another ticket's manifest.
- **Commands are self-dispatching.** Each `EditCommand` subclass implements its own `applyTo`/`previewOn` inside its group's `part` file, so command tickets never edit `edit_command.dart`.
- **Native glue is frozen after ENG-06.** ENG-01 defines the Pigeon surface, ENG-07/ENG-08 write the glue, and ENG-06 applies the spike outcomes and freezes both after IOS-01 and AND-01 report (D-42). Service tickets implement the service classes the glue already calls; Pigeon or glue changes after ENG-06 need a new lead-approved [INTEGRATION] ticket.
- **Integration tickets** (marked [INTEGRATION]: INT-01…INT-05, ENG-06, and CORE-28's two-attribute touch of the app manifest) are the only tickets that edit files owned elsewhere or shared app-root files, in the order of §7.

## 3. Milestones

| Milestone | Name | Scope | Exit criteria | Tickets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Foundations and contracts | iOS target 15.0, editor CI, pure core types, RenderPlan v1 contract and fixtures, engine API + fake, plugin scaffold split into Pigeon/Dart engine (ENG-01), iOS glue (ENG-07), Android glue (ENG-08) and example host + CI (ENG-09), test media, whisper vendoring + C ABI, transcription contracts, UI kit additions, vwish_editor skeleton, Home edit button, orientation stack. | Every new package analyzes and tests green in editor-ci; contract fixtures (incl. the grid-cut fixture) committed; FakeEditorEngine passes the contract kit; Home button hidden behind VWISH_EDITOR; the owner's sign-off on the D-43 platform narrowings (a)–(d), (f) is recorded in ARCH D-43. | 21 |
| **M1** | Editing core and de-risking spikes | All editing commands, visual packing and layer limits, snapshot history and transactions, SRT/VTT and .cube formats, geometry and text animation evaluation, render-math and audio-mix reference + goldens, iOS and Android engine spikes (started on day 1 in spike hosts) with go/no-go, Pigeon/build config frozen after the spikes (ENG-06), whisper shim with host tests, device channel. | Every ARCH §7.2 command implemented with goldens; spikes answered every [VERIFY] they own; Android go/no-go recorded and, on no-go, the owner's sign-off on AND-16's degradations (D-43e) recorded; whisper host tests green (TSan/ASan). | 22 |
| **M2** | Persistence, RenderPlan compiler, native media services, speech core | Project codec/migrations/atomic store/repository/autosave/recovery/media pool/relink/GC, full compiler + diff + export settings, PlanSync, text sprites, Dart service glue, probe/thumbnails/waveforms/speech audio/proxies/freeze/reverse on iOS and Android, whisper native builds, model store/downloader, transcript cache, segmenter, timeline mapping, iOS segmented writer/job interruption and audio gain tap. | Core persistence survives fault injection; compile goldens for every lowering row; media services pass native tests on simulator and emulator; whisper builds for both platforms and the app still launches on the iOS 15.8 and 16.7 lab devices. | 34 |
| **M3** | Editor shell, timeline and live preview | Projects screen, new project/import, editor layout, controller/transactions, timeline (viewport, canvas, headers, gestures, move/trim/split/ripple/clipboard, markers), transport/playhead, action registry + shortcuts, toolbar + inspector host, preview surface + text overlay + manipulation, thumbnail/waveform caches, native composition/compositor/preview sessions, Android paused-frame renderer (and the contingency engine only on an AND-01 no-go), app wiring v1, model fuzzer. | On the iOS simulator and Android emulator with VWISH_EDITOR=true: Home -> Projects -> editor with live frame-accurate preview; timeline edits reflected in preview within budget (Android structural budgets per ARCH §13.4); fuzz-lite green. | 32 |
| **M4** | Editing features and native export | Transform/crop/mask, adjust/filters/LUT, speed, keyframes, transitions, PiP/chroma, format/project/history, text, subtitles + SRT/VTT, audio, voiceover, freeze/reverse/replace/tasks, media bin + drag and drop, export pipelines (iOS on the segmented resumable writer, Android, Dart glue), recorder, pickers, drop targets, whisper runtime and orchestrator. | Every owner feature except the export sheet, captions UI, media-health flows and the player entry works end to end on simulator/emulator; native export passes conformance on both platforms, including projects without audio. | 24 |
| **M5** | Export UI, auto captions, media health, player entry, legal, platform declarations | Auto captions flow + regenerate, export sheet, relink/recovery/migration UX, player Edit + handoff, privacy/terms/licences, iOS background export + Android FGS, iOS Info.plist/entitlements/privacy manifest, app wiring v2. | Complete feature set wired in the app behind the flags; privacy text matches the model host. | 10 |
| **M6** | Hardening, QA and release | On-device E2E on iOS Simulator and Android Emulator, parity/accuracy/A-V, export conformance + preset matrix + audio measurements, performance budgets, soak, AI eval and AI E2E, accessibility, overflow matrix, persistence survival, core benchmarks, conditional tile cache, release. | ARCH §23 release checklist complete with evidence; release builds pass VWISH_EDITOR=true and VWISH_AUTO_CAPTIONS=true. | 15 |

## 4. Critical path and parallel lanes

**Longest dependency chain** (24 tickets; unchanged after the review edits, re-computed by script): INT-01 → CORE-01 → CORE-02 → CORE-04 → CORE-03 → CORE-05 → CORE-08 → CORE-09 → CORE-10 → CORE-16 → CORE-31 → CORE-32 → API-02 → UX-08 → UX-14 → UX-18 → UX-19 → UX-31 → UX-37 → UX-38 → INT-04 → QA-00 → QA-01 → INT-05.

**Lanes that run in parallel** once M0 lands:
- **Core lane** (CORE-xx, pure Dart, `dart test` only): commands → persistence → compiler. Unblocks everything else through types and fixtures; CORE-29 (plan contract) is deliberately in M0.
- **Engine lane** (API-xx, ENG-01…09): contract + fake first so UI work never waits on native code; ENG-01 (Pigeon + Dart engine + minimal native plugin placeholders) → ENG-09 (example host + CI) → ENG-07 (iOS glue) and ENG-08 (Android glue) in parallel → ENG-06 freeze after the spikes.
- **iOS lane** (IOS-xx) and **Android lane** (AND-xx): **IOS-01 and AND-01 start on day 1** in throwaway spike hosts (`spikes/ios_engine/`, `spikes/android_engine/`; no dependencies; self-generated media until ENG-05 lands) and must report before ENG-06 freezes the Pigeon surface (D-42); then media services (incl. IOS-17 segmented writer and IOS-18 audio tap), then composition/compositor/preview (Android: AND-17 paused-frame renderer; AND-16 only on an AND-01 no-go, adding about 3 weeks to the Android lane), then export and platform services.
- **AI lane** (AI-xx): vendoring and C shim in parallel with core; the orchestrator (AI-13) needs the runtime, the stores and CORE-15.
- **UI lane** (UI-01, UX-xx): skeleton in M0; shell/timeline/preview in M3 against fakes; panels in M4; flows and entry points in M5.
- **Integration** (INT-xx): INT-01 first; INT-02 makes the editor reachable in the app in M3; INT-03/INT-04 in M5; INT-05 last.
- **QA** (QA-xx): M6, after the features they certify; QA tickets don't change product code (defects become FIX tickets).

## 6. Tickets

### M0: Foundations and contracts

#### INT-01 · Repo foundations: iOS 15.0 target, dependency rules, editor CI [INTEGRATION]

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Integration
- **Depends on:** —
- **Owns:**
  - `ios/Podfile`
  - `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
  - `test/architecture/dependency_rules_test.dart`
  - `test/architecture/fixtures/`
  - `.github/workflows/editor-ci.yml`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/flutter_packages.sh`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/nightly.sh`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/README.md`
  - `docs/editor/ARCHITECTURE.md` (D-43 sign-off status only)
- **Spec:** [INTEGRATION] (1) Raise the iOS deployment target 13.0 -> 15.0 exactly as ARCH §3.1/D-29: IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 15.0 in every iOS Runner and RunnerTests build configuration of ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (leave macOS untouched), `platform :ios, '15.0'` in ios/Podfile plus a post_install hook that lifts any pod below 15.0 to 15.0. (2) test/architecture/dependency_rules_test.dart parses every packages/*/pubspec.yaml and scans Dart imports to enforce ARCH §4.2 rules 1-7 (packages not yet created are skipped; rule 8 is UX-01's), and scans every vwish_features file an editor ticket touches (UX-02, UX-03, UX-04, UX-41, UX-42 owns lists) for the ARCH §1.3 forbidden Material names as whole identifiers (so Vwish* wrappers pass; empty baseline, the files have zero matches today). Negative fixtures in test/architecture/fixtures/ prove each rule fires. (3) .github/workflows/editor-ci.yml per ARCH §22: jobs dart-core, flutter-packages, whisper-host, android-unit, android-emulator, ios (self-hosted macOS, workflow input `runner` falls back to macos-15), nightly (cron). Each job runs scripts/ci/editor/<job>.sh when present and prints a skip notice otherwise; nightly runs every scripts/ci/editor/nightly.d/*.sh. Path filters: packages/vwish_editor*/**, packages/vwish_transcription/**, packages/vwish_whisper/**, test/architecture/**, scripts/ci/editor/**, the workflow. (4) flutter_packages.sh (analyze + test for each editor Flutter package that exists + root test/architecture), nightly.sh, README.md naming script owners (core.sh CORE-01; whisper_host.sh AI-03; android_unit.sh, android_emulator.sh, ios.sh, check_ios_min_os.sh ENG-09; e2e_ios.sh QA-01; e2e_android.sh QA-02; nightly.d/* per ticket) and the self-hosted runner prerequisites (Xcode 26.6, `brew install cmake` ≥ 3.28, the device lab list incl. the iPhone 7 on iOS 15.8 and iPhone 8 on iOS 16.7, D-41). (5) Present the D-43 platform narrowings (a)–(d), (f) to the owner with the remux option for (d) and record the answer and date in ARCHITECTURE.md D-43 (status cell only).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** existing `flutter test` suite and `flutter build ios --no-codesign --debug` pass; no iOS config keeps 13.0; dependency and forbidden-Material tests green on main and red on every negative fixture; actionlint clean; existing release workflows unchanged; D-43 owner sign-off recorded (M0 exit criterion).

#### CORE-01 · vwish_editor_core package scaffold, barrels, purity test

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** INT-01
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/pubspec.yaml`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/analysis_options.yaml`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/model.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/ops.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/eval.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/formats.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/plan.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/codec.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/store.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/purity_test.dart`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/core.sh`
- **Spec:** Create packages/vwish_editor_core: pure Dart, deps exactly meta, collection, crypto, path, characters (dev: test, checks, json_schema for CORE-29's schema tests); strict analysis (strict-casts, strict-inference, strict-raw-types). Barrels lib/{model,ops,eval,formats,plan,codec,store}.dart export exactly the files of ARCH §4.3 (as corrected: MediaAccessPort lives in model/pool; ops/limits.dart is CORE-09; model/keyframes/keyframe_data.dart is CORE-03). A directory entry is exported through its sub-barrel `<dir>/<dirname>.dart`, owned by that directory's ticket. Create D-33 placeholders (header `// OWNER: CORE-xx`; may be empty libraries) for every exported file so the package analyzes from day one. Barrels never change after this ticket: a ticket that needs more public files re-exports them from one of its own files. test/purity_test.dart fails on any package:flutter or package:vwish_* import, and on dart:io / dart:isolate outside lib/src/store/ (source scan, with negative fixtures). scripts/ci/editor/core.sh: dart pub get, dart analyze --fatal-infos, dart test, and `dart run benchmark/run.dart --check` when benchmark/ exists.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** `dart test` passes with no Flutter SDK on PATH; purity test catches each negative fixture; package analyzes clean; core.sh runs in the dart-core CI job.

#### CORE-02 · Time, frame grid, timecode and ids

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-01
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/time/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ids/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/tool/gen_frame_vectors.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/vectors/frame_grid.json`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/time/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ids/`
- **Spec:** Implement ARCH §5. lib/src/time/: TimeUs, FrameRate(num, den) with timeOfFrame(k)=ceilDiv(k*1e6*den, num), frameIndexOf, quantize, quantizeNearest, isOnGrid, and the platform-time rule of ARCH §5/D-35: frameIndexNearest(tau) = floorDiv(tau*num + 500000*den, 1000000*den) and platformTimeOfFrame(k) = P(k) = round(k*1e6/fps); FrameRate.project validation (v1: den == 1 and num in {24,25,30,48,50,60}, D-03; the type stays rational); TimeRange (half-open, intersect/contains/shift); negative-safe ceilDiv/floorDiv; Timecode format `mm:ss:ff` (`h:mm:ss:ff` from 1 h) and parse of `1:23`, `1:23:12`, `83.5s`, `+2s`, `-10f` relative to a base. lib/src/ids/: extension types over String ProjectId 'pr_', TrackId 'tr_', ItemId 'it_', MediaId 'md_', MarkerId 'mk_', TransitionId 'tx_', LinkId 'ln_' (prefix + 12 base62 chars from Random.secure), IdGenerator, SeededIdGenerator. tool/gen_frame_vectors.dart writes test/fixtures/vectors/frame_grid.json (per fps in {24,25,30,48,50,60}: k in {0,1,2,3,fps-1,fps,fps+1,fps+2,1000, 1 h, 1 h+1, 1 h+2, 24 h-1} so k ≡ 0, 1, 2 (mod 3) are all covered, with timeOfFrame, frameIndexOf at t-1, t, t+1, floor(k·1e6/fps), P(k), the rational (k, fps), the expected frameIndexNearest of each platform form (= k), frameIndexNearest at P(k) ± (half a frame − 1 µs), and a placeholder `androidSeekMsRounding` filled from AND-01's measurement by ENG-06's record); the committed file is read by Swift/Kotlin tests.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** properties frameIndexOf(timeOfFrame(k)) == k and frameIndexOf(timeOfFrame(k+1)-1) == k for every supported fps, sampled k plus edges up to 24 h; frameIndexNearest(x) == k for x in {timeOfFrame(k), floor(k·1e6/fps), P(k)} and for every x within half a frame − 1 µs of k·1e6/fps; P(k) equals Media3's double formula round((1e6/fps)·k) for all sampled k up to 24 h; no product exceeds 2^53; Timecode.parse(format(t)) == quantize(t); seeded ids deterministic, secure ids unique over 1e6 draws; regenerating vectors yields no diff.

#### CORE-03 · Core immutable model types

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-02, CORE-04
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/model.dart`

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/keyframes/keyframe_data.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/model/core/`
- **Spec:** All immutable model types of ARCH §6.1-6.6 (domain.md §4): EditProject (id, meta, timeline, pool, view, docRevision; getters settings, tracks, markers, media, duration, revision and a lazily built cached `index` for id lookups), ProjectMeta (name, createdAt, updatedAt, origin incl. fromPlayer path+fingerprint, editCount), Timeline (settings, tracks, markers, revision), ProjectSettings/CanvasSpec (aspect w:h + baseShortSide -> even px)/BackgroundSpec (Solid | BlurOfMain), ViewState, TrackKind, AudioRole, Track (isMain, locked, hidden, muted, solo, audioRole, subtitle, items, transitions, changedAt), sealed TimelineItem with MediaClip/TextItem/SubtitleCue, SpeedSpec (ConstantSpeed | SpeedRamp), VisualProps with Transform2D/FitMode/CropRect/ColorAdjust/DetailFx/LookRef/ChromaKey/MaskSpec, AudioProps, TextStyleSpec (+BoxStyle, StrokeStyle, ShadowStyle), TextAnimation, SubtitleTrackData/SubtitleStyle/SubtitlePosition, CaptionProvenance, CueOrigin, SubtitleCueDraft, Transition/TransitionKind/TransitionDirection/TransitionRef, Marker, Vec2, and keyframe data (Keyframe, KeyframeTrack, KeyframeSet) in model/keyframes/keyframe_data.dart (PropertyKey metadata is CORE-05). Defaults and ranges exactly as ARCH §6. Structural sharing: unmodifiable lists, copy-on-write per track; canonical track order helpers (D-09 display order is reverse z).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every type @immutable with copyWith, ==, hashCode; lists unmodifiable; `index` built once per instance; canonical order and band helpers tested; ux.md §2.1 getters exist; no dart:io.

#### CORE-04 · Media pool model, MediaAccessPort and quickHash

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-02
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/pool/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/model/pool/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/quickhash/`
- **Spec:** lib/src/model/pool/ (sub-barrel pool/pool.dart), ARCH §6.8 and §9.2: MediaKind, MediaAsset, sealed MediaLocator (AppRelativeLocator(root documents|support|cache, relPath), FileLocator, ContentUriLocator, BookmarkLocator(bookmarkB64, lastKnownPath)), MediaOwnership, MediaFingerprint, MediaOrigin, DerivedSpec (reversed(media, range) | still(media, time)) with a stable specHash, AssetStatus, ProxyState, immutable MediaPool, PoolChange (sticky) and PoolEdit/PoolDelta (undoable) value types, ResolvedMedia, MediaProbe, ColorTransfer, PickedMedia {uri, displayName, isTemporaryCopy, bookmark, sizeBytes}, PickedMediaHandle, MediaStat, MediaAccessFailure and the MediaAccessPort interface (moved here from store/ so API-01 can implement it at M0; no dart:io). quickHash: pure `computeQuickHash(Uint8List head, Uint8List tail, int size)` reproducing packages/vwish_data/lib/src/scanner/media_identity.dart byte for byte (sha1(first min(size,64 KiB) + last 64 KiB only when size > 64 KiB, overlapping when size < 128 KiB, + utf8(':$size')); empty file -> '').
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** value equality/hashCode/copyWith on all types; sealed switch exhaustiveness tests; test/fixtures/quickhash/*.json holds expected hashes for 6 files (1 byte, 64 KiB, 64 KiB+1, 100 KiB, 128 KiB, 3 MiB) produced once with vwish_data's implementation (procedure in the fixture README) and the core function matches all of them.

#### CORE-05 · Property keys, keyframe evaluation

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-03
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/keyframes/keyframes.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/keyframes/property_keys.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/keyframes/keyframe_ops.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/evaluate.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/keyframes/`
- **Spec:** PropertyKey<T> registry (ARCH §6.7, domain.md §4.11) with stable id, displayName, unit, min/max/step/default, displayScale, keyframable flag, channel ids (`transform.position.x` ...), appliesTo item kinds, and static read/write against items, for every property: position, scale, rotation, opacity, flips, crop, the 8 ColorAdjust values, sharpness, blur, vignette, look intensity, chroma (color, similarity, smoothness, spill), mask (shape, center, size, rotation, corner, feather, opacity, invert), volume, mute, fades, and text style fields. Keyframable set exactly as ARCH §6.7. keyframe_ops: shift (start trim), scale (speed change), partition at a split with boundary keys, keys outside [0, duration) kept. eval/evaluate.dart: evaluate<T>(item, key, t) linear, held outside first/last key, rotation in plain degrees, Vec2 channels.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** table test covers every property with ranges/defaults; interpolation and hold exact; Vec2 writes both channels at the same t; out-of-range keys kept and ignored by evaluation; partition preserves evaluated values at every frame of both halves; non-keyframable keys reject keyframe writes.

#### CORE-06 · Clip time map and speed math

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-03
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/clip_time_map.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/speed_math.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/time_map/`
- **Spec:** ClipTimeMap for a MediaClip (ARCH §6.4, domain.md §4.5): constant speed in [0.1, 10] and SpeedRamp (2-16 points over normalized source position, y in [0.1, 10]); reversed clips via s' = sourceIn + sourceOut - s. API: toSource(t), timelineTimeOf(s) (exact inverse, null if trimmed away; used by AI-12), speedAt(t), sourceOut, durationFor(sourceRange, speed) = max(1 frame, quantizeNearest(T)), lower({maxErrorUs: 250}) -> contiguous List<MapSegment(t0, t1, s0, s1)> covering the clip, each with rate in [0.1, 10] and **every breakpoint t on a frame start of the project grid** (ARCH §11.3, D-35). Closed forms: segment time (L/b)·ln(v1/v0) (L·dx/v0 when b = 0), inverse x(tau) = x0 + v0(e^{b·tau/L} - 1)/b. A clip's video layer and audio segment are lowered from the same map (A/V sync contract, ARCH §11.5).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** closed forms vs numerical integration within 1 µs over 10k seeded random ramps; timelineTimeOf(toSource(t)) == t ± 1 µs; lowered maps within 250 µs at every frame start and every breakpoint on the grid; maps of the two halves of a split equal the original at every frame; reversed maps verified; lower() of a 7-point ramp <= 0.2 ms (benchmark test).

#### CORE-29 · RenderPlan v1 types, JSON codec, JSON Schema, validator, contract fixtures

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-02

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/render_plans/contract/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/plan/schema/`
- **Spec:** Delivered early: it unblocks the engine contract and native work. Dart types for ARCH §11.2 exactly (RenderPlan, Canvas incl. gridFps, PlanAsset, PlanLayer incl. seq, Effects (adj, detail, lut, chroma, mask), AnimChannel [[tUs, v]...], CanvasMask, AudioSeg, Requirements, RenderPlanPatch, PlanTransient), deterministic JSON encode/decode (integer µs, '#RRGGBBAA', unknown keys ignored, defaults omitted), the JSON Schema 2020-12 file, effects_reference.md (ARCH §11.6 render math restated normatively with the D-08 order), validator for ARCH §11.3 invariants incl. grid edges on canvas.gridFps and non-overlapping seq slots (returns layer ids), SpriteRequest/SpriteManifest types, EncodeSettings (+ExportContainer mp4|mov, VideoCodec h264|hevc) per ARCH §12.4. About 25 hand-written fixtures in test/fixtures/render_plans/contract/ covering every key, every animatable channel, transitions-as-lowered windows, holds, sprites with reveal, LUT assets, audio gain envelopes up to 2.0, patches and transients, **grid_cuts_30fps.json** (layer edges at frames k ≡ 1 and 2 mod 3, e.g. 31, 32, 61, 62, with `grid_cuts_30fps.expected_active.json` listing the active layer ids for every frame), an export plan with gridFps 30 and fps 24, a plan with an empty `audio` array (no-audio export), plus invalid fixtures for each invariant.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every valid fixture validates against the schema (schema test via a small Dart validator or vendored JSON-Schema checker in dev deps) and round-trips byte-identically; every invalid fixture fails with the right layer id; encode of a 2,000-layer plan <= 40 ms in Isolate.run on the CI host (benchmark test).

- **Spec:** Flutter package (no native code), deps flutter, meta, collection, vwish_editor_core. Declare the complete contract of ARCH §12.1-12.5 verbatim: EditorEngine, EditorEngineConfig, PreviewConfig/PreviewSession/PreviewClock/SeekAck/PlanAck/SeekKind/PreviewQuality/PreviewEditingMode/PreviewEvent, ThumbnailSource/ThumbnailRequest/ThumbnailTile/ThumbnailHandle/ThumbPriority, WaveformSource/WaveformPeaks, MediaJobs/MediaJob/JobPriority/GeneratedAsset/ProxyStatus, SpeechAudioJobRequest/ExtractedSpeechAudio, ExportService/ExportPreflight/ExportJob/ExportJobState/ExportProgress/ExportPhase/ExportResult/ExportWarning, VoiceRecorder/RecordingSession/MicPermission/RecordedAsset/RecordingInterruption, MediaPicker/MediaPickRequest, FileHandoff/FileHandoffResult, MediaAccess (implements core MediaAccessPort), BackgroundWorkGuard/BackgroundLease, ExternalDropTarget/ExternalDrop, EngineSignal/CacheTrimLevel, EditorCapabilities, DeviceTier, BackgroundExportKind, EngineErrorCode, sealed EngineFailure. `typedef EngineMedia = ResolvedMedia`; PickedMedia/MediaProbe/EncodeSettings/RenderPlan are re-exported core types (D-27). D-33 skeleton: placeholders for lib/src/{plan_sync,plan_transport}.dart (API-02), lib/src/math/ and lib/src/reference/ (API-03), lib/src/render_prep/ (API-04). FakeEditorEngine (lib/testing.dart): deterministic fake clock, configurable capabilities, applies plans/patches with core applyPatch and checks `from` revisions (planOutOfSync), exact-seek acks on the frame grid, jobs with scripted progress/cancel, failure injection, call log, a fake texture placeholder. test/contract/engine_contract.dart: reusable contract kit (exported from lib/testing.dart) checking clock seq rules, exact-seek ack, patch revision semantics, transient non-persistence, job cancel semantics, export reattach.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** package analyzes clean; FakeEditorEngine passes the contract kit; dependency rules hold (INT-01 test); every public type has dartdoc linking ARCH sections.

#### ENG-01 · Engine plugin: Pigeon surface definitions and generated code, MobileEditorEngine, event router, error mapper

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Engine (Dart)
- **Depends on:** API-01, INT-01
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/pubspec.yaml`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/pigeons/engine_api.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/lib/vwish_editor_engine.dart`

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/main/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/pigeon/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/test/glue/`
- **Spec:** (Split from the former ENG-01 by the review, D-42.) Flutter plugin package (ios, android; desktop not declared) per ARCH §4.4 and §12.6. pigeons/engine_api.dart with pigeon ^29.0.0 (EngineHostApi, PreviewHostApi, JobsHostApi, ExportHostApi incl. `start(..., whenDetached)`, `resume`, `consumeJobRecord`, RecorderHostApi, PlatformHostApi, EngineEventsApi @EventChannelApi multiplexed stream; capabilities message with tier minimal, maxVisualSequences, maxTextureSize) with generated Dart/Swift/Kotlin committed. MobileEditorEngine implements EditorEngine over Pigeon; error_mapper maps FlutterError codes to EngineFailure (unknown -> internal; never a raw PlatformException); event_router demultiplexes EngineEventMsg by sessionId/jobId with native rate limits (clock <= 10 Hz, progress <= 4 Hz, levels 20 Hz). D-33 skeleton: Dart placeholders for mobile_preview_session/mobile_jobs/mobile_recorder/mobile_platform_services/mobile_media_access/mobile_export, and **minimal native placeholders** so the plugin builds from M0: `ios/vwish_editor_engine.podspec`, `ios/Classes/VwishEditorEnginePlugin.swift`, `android/build.gradle.kts`, `android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and `VwishEditorEnginePlugin.kt` (headers `OWNER: ENG-07` / `OWNER: ENG-08`; the plugin registers no host API, so every call fails with notSupportedOnDevice). The Pigeon surface may still change until ENG-06 freezes it after the spikes.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** Dart tests with mocked channels: every EngineErrorCode maps; events demultiplexed and throttled; resumable and completedWhileDetached job records decode; Pigeon regeneration produces no diff; package and placeholders analyze clean.

#### ENG-05 · Test media fixtures and frame barcode readers

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** Engine (Dart)
- **Depends on:** ENG-01
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/tool/make_fixtures.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/test_fixtures/media/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/lib/src/testing/frame_barcode.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Support/FrameBarcode.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/support/FrameBarcode.kt`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/test/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/support/`
- **Spec:** tool/make_fixtures.swift (macOS, AVAssetWriter + Core Graphics) generates small fixtures into test_fixtures/media/ (total <= 30 MB, committed): frame_counter_1080p30.mp4 (8 s, per-frame barcode + digits), frame_counter_720p25.mp4 and _24 / _48 / _60 variants, clap_flash_av.mp4 (flash frame + click at known times, AAC with edit list and priming), vfr_720p.mp4, hlg_10bit_720p.mov (HEVC Main10 HLG), rotated_90.mov, speech_10s.m4a (synthesized or CC0 speech; licence recorded), surround_5_1.m4a with a centre-only tone, **mono tone fixtures tone_440hz.wav and tone_1khz.wav (10 s, −12 dBFS) and tone_under_video.mp4 (frame_counter video + 1 kHz tone)** for QA-11's pitch and mix checks, still_4k.jpg, alpha.png, mono/stereo WAV. AVFoundation cannot write Matroska or WebM, so **sample_h264_aac.mkv and sample_vp9_opus.webm are small CC0/public-domain files committed with their source URL and licence in the README** (used for iOS refusal paths and Android 'editable when decoders exist'). README with the generation command and, per file, its semantic description (stream layout, durations, barcode ranges). Barcode readers: Dart (decode frame index from an RGBA buffer, used by integration tests via debugCaptureFrame), Swift and Kotlin equivalents for native tests (loading through the example host is verified by ENG-09).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** regeneration is **semantically equivalent** (V-U6: same barcodes per frame, durations ±1 frame, stream layout, tone frequency ±1 Hz), not byte-identical, because hardware encoders and synthesized speech change across OS updates; the Dart reader decodes all 240 frames of frame_counter_1080p30 from frames extracted on the dev Mac and the Kotlin reader does the same from PNG frames in a JVM unit test; the MKV/WebM files probe with the expected streams.

#### ENG-09 · Example host app, native test harness and editor CI scripts

  - `scripts/ci/editor/android_emulator.sh`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/ios.sh`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/check_ios_min_os.sh`
- **Spec:** (Split from the former ENG-01, D-42.) example/: host app whose ios RunnerTests target uses an Xcode synchronized folder (so later tickets add test directories without editing the pbxproj) with folder references to ../test_fixtures, core test/fixtures and engine_api test_fixtures; Android source sets expose the same fixtures to src/test and src/androidTest. The example Info.plist **pre-declares every key native tests need** (NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription, BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers = [com.vecvel.vwish.export.*]) so IOS-13/14/15 never edit it. CI scripts: android_unit.sh, android_emulator.sh, ios.sh (fails early with the `brew install cmake` instruction when CMake ≥ 3.28 is missing; builds packages/vwish_whisper's xcframework with tool/build_ios_xcframework.sh --if-missing when that script exists; runs check_ios_min_os.sh). check_ios_min_os.sh (D-41): for the engine pod, WhisperCore.xcframework and a built app, fails on any strongly bound symbol introduced after iOS 15.0 or any linked framework/minimum OS above 15.0 (`xcrun vtool -show-build`, `nm -um`, `otool -L`, with an allowlist of weak-linked frameworks such as BackgroundTasks).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** `flutter build ios --no-codesign` and `flutter build apk` of the example pass with ENG-01's placeholder plugin classes; ENG-05 fixtures load in RunnerTests and androidTest; CI scripts green in editor-ci; check_ios_min_os.sh fails on a negative fixture (a binary with a strongly bound iOS 17 symbol) and passes on the example; V-N8 (@EventChannelApi on Swift + Kotlin) confirmed once ENG-07/ENG-08 land (recorded in their PRs).

#### ENG-07 · iOS plugin glue, engine core and native service placeholders

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Core/Paths.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Glue/`
- **Spec:** (Split from the former ENG-01, D-42.) Thin Swift glue for every host API of ARCH §12.6 against ENG-01's generated Pigeon code: validate arguments, hop to engine queues, delegate to service protocols, reply asynchronously, never block. D-33 skeleton: placeholder classes for every iOS service file of ARCH §4.4 (IOS-02..IOS-18, incl. Media/{SegmentedWriter,SegmentConcat,SegmentCheckpoint}, Core/JobInterruption and Audio/{GainTap,TapEnvelope}) returning notSupportedOnDevice. Core: EngineContext, ErrorCodes, EventHub, Log (no paths), Paths (Dart-supplied roots only). podspec: platform :ios '15.0', Swift, source_files Classes/**, `OTHER_CFLAGS` with `-Werror=unguarded-availability-new` (Swift already rejects unguarded newer APIs), resource bundle with PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy (FileTimestamp C617.1, DiskSpace E174.1, SystemBootTime 35F9.1); no bundled media resources (the spacer is generated at runtime by IOS-08).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** `pod lib lint` (static, iOS 15) passes; capabilities() round-trips on the iOS simulator through the example host (placeholder capabilities: supported false); glue tests in RunnerTests/Glue green (argument validation, error code mapping, queue hops); V-N8 recorded.

#### ENG-08 · Android plugin glue, engine core, Gradle, manifest and native service placeholders

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/test/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/glue/`
- **Spec:** (Split from the former ENG-01, D-42.) Thin Kotlin glue for every host API against ENG-01's generated Pigeon code. D-33 skeleton: placeholder classes for every Android service file of ARCH §4.4 (AND-02..AND-17, incl. preview/{PausedFrameRenderer,LayerCompositorGl,StructuralDebouncer} and the empty preview/fallback/ package) returning notSupportedOnDevice. Core: EngineContext, ErrorCodes, EventHub, EngineThreads (vwish-preview, vwish-gl, vwish-export, vwish-jobs, vwish-io), Paths. build.gradle.kts: minSdk 24, Media3 1.11.1 (transformer, effect, exoplayer, common, inspector, inspector-frame, muxer), concurrent-futures, activity (V-N14); lint.xml makes `UnstableApi` and `ExperimentalApi` opt-in-required errors so every Media3 file carries `@OptIn(UnstableApi::class, ExperimentalApi::class)`. Plugin manifest per ARCH §20.4 (RECORD_AUDIO, POST_NOTIFICATIONS, FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROCESSING, FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE maxSdk 28, ExportService mediaProcessing|dataSync, FileProvider ${applicationId}.vwish.editor.files, Photo Picker backport ModuleDependencies entry).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** capabilities() round-trips on an Android emulator through the example host; glue JVM tests green; lint fails on a negative fixture missing the opt-in; V-N14 recorded; manifest merge of the example app clean.

#### AI-01 · Vendor whisper.cpp v1.9.4 (pruned) with re-vendor script

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** AI (whisper + transcription)
- **Depends on:** —
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_whisper/third_party/`
  - `packages/vwish_whisper/tool/vendor_whisper.sh`
  - `packages/vwish_whisper/LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md`
- **Spec:** ai.md §4.2: vendor whisper.cpp v1.9.4 (commit 927cfce34f31707e17f2bff35c349632fb9e2c3a, ggml 0.23.0) pruned to ~7.8 MB / ~192 files under third_party/whisper.cpp with third_party/VENDORED.md (commit, tarball sha256, pruning list). tool/vendor_whisper.sh downloads the tagged tarball, checks its sha256 and reproduces the tree byte for byte. LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md with MIT notices for whisper.cpp and ggml. Review the v1.9.5 (`d1be6fde`, 2026-10-06) changelog: either re-pin to v1.9.5 (update the commit, tarball sha256 and ARCH §16.1) or record in VENDORED.md why v1.9.4 stays.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** the script reproduces the committed tree with no diff; a host CMake configure + build of libwhisper with the ai.md §4.3 (Android) and §4.4 (iOS) option sets succeeds on macOS using only the pruned tree (V-A9); the v1.9.5 decision is recorded.

D-33 skeleton: placeholders for lib/src/runtime/ and lib/src/ffi/library_loader.dart (AI-07), lib/src/device/ (AI-06), ios/vwish_whisper.podspec (AI-05; builds without the native library), android/build.gradle.kts + manifest (AI-04; no CMake yet), ios/Classes and android kotlin plugin classes (AI-06). No DynamicLibrary is opened at import time.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** on macOS/Windows/Linux the package compiles and WhisperRuntime.open() returns unsupported(platform); desktop release workflows stay green; ABI version check test; ffigen regeneration has no diff.

- **Spec:** Create packages/vwish_editor (no go_router dependency: screens take navigation callbacks supplied by the app router; deps: flutter, flutter_riverpod 2, vwish_editor_core, vwish_editor_engine_api, vwish_transcription, vwish_editor_fonts, vwish_ui_kit, vwish_data, vwish_platform, vwish_domain, vwish_features (only via chrome/orientation/storage)). editor_availability: EditorAvailability.platform (synchronous: supported on iOS/Android when VWISH_EDITOR define is true; hidden on desktop, D-17, no teaser state), showsEntryPoints; editorDeviceSupportProvider (async from capabilities). editor_providers: root providers of ARCH §17.3 (overridden by EditorBootstrap) and per-project family declarations; editor_prefs: `editor.` SharedPreferences keys. contracts/: EditorActionId (complete list of ARCH §17.6), ToolId, InspectorRoute. wiring/action_bindings.dart merges the per-feature binding files. debug/: rebuild counters and perf hooks used by QA-04. D-33 skeleton: placeholders (owner header, declared public widget/class names, 'not available yet' UI) for every vwish_editor file listed in ARCH §4.6, every actions/bindings/<feature>_bindings.dart named in BUILD_PLAN, assets/looks/ (README placeholder, folder declared in pubspec) and packages/vwish_editor_fonts/pubspec.yaml (package placeholder owned by UX-30). The pubspec declares every dependency the package needs in this release (incl. dev: flutter_test, integration_test). test/support/: FakeProjectRepository wrapper over core InMemoryProjectRepository (once available; stub until CORE-25), EditorTestHarness (ProviderScope with FakeEditorEngine, fake repo, FakeTranscriptionService), SurfaceMatrix helpers (ARCH §17.9 sizes and text scales, takeException/expectInside/fitsFully), and `expectOwnerUiRules(tester)` (fails when a VwishPressable with a text label has a circular shape, or chrome text resolves to a family other than Figtree; content text inside the preview overlay is exempt). test/architecture/: no-Material-chrome scan of lib/ (ARCH §1.3 list, whole-identifier matching), UserConsent.accepted( call-site restriction (rule 8), pubspec import rule 7.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** package and placeholders analyze clean; availability matrix tests (platform × flags; desktop always hidden); architecture tests green and failing on negative fixtures (incl. `TextField` used directly, while `VwishTextField` passes); expectOwnerUiRules fails on a round text button fixture and a non-Figtree chrome fixture; harness boots a placeholder EditorScreen.

#### UX-02 · Orientation owner stack (ScreenOrientationPolicy)

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** UI/UX
- **Depends on:** —
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_features/lib/src/player/vwish_player_actions.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_features/lib/src/player/screen_orientation_policy.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_features/lib/orientation.dart`
  - `test/editor_entry/orientation_policy_test.dart`
- **Spec:** ux.md §4.5: ScreenOrientationPolicy owner stack with enter(owner, mode)/release(owner)/toggle, OrientationMode (appDefault, playerLandscape, free ...); the top owner's mode is applied; releasing a non-top owner keeps the top; PlayerOrientation keeps its public API as a thin wrapper so existing player code and tests are unchanged. New entry point lib/orientation.dart exports the policy for vwish_editor.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** existing player orientation tests pass unchanged; new tests: editor over player -> pop restores the player mode; non-top release keeps top; app default restored when the stack empties; desktop no-op.

#### UX-03 · Home header edit button and features chrome entry point

- **Milestone:** M0 · **Area:** UI/UX
- **Depends on:** —
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_features/lib/src/library/vwish_home_screen.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_features/lib/chrome.dart`
  - `test/editor_entry/home_edit_button_test.dart`
- **Spec:** ARCH §17.1: new optional VwishHomeScreen.onOpenEditor callback (null hides the button) threaded to _HomeHeader; VwishIconButton(icon: Icons.movie_edit, variant: tonal, size: 44, iconSize: 22, tooltip: 'Video editor', semanticLabel: 'Open video editor') placed immediately LEFT of the settings gear with VwishSpacing.sm between them; the title keeps >= 96 px at 280 px width and text scale 1.35 (ellipsizes before the buttons shrink). lib/chrome.dart exports the shared screen chrome vwish_editor may reuse (screen scaffold/header/back button/settings row widgets as listed in ux.md §3.3); vwish_features never imports editor packages.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** widget tests: button order [logo, title, edit, gear]; hidden when callback null; tap invokes callback; no overflow at 280/320/390 px × 0.85/1.0/1.35; existing home tests pass unchanged.

### M1: Editing core and de-risking spikes

#### CORE-07 · Geometry, text layout spec and text animation evaluation

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-05, CORE-06
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/geometry.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/text_layout_spec.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/text_animation_eval.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/geometry/`
- **Spec:** The single implementation of placement math used by the UI, compiler and AI. geometry.dart: baseSize(fit, crop, source display size, canvas), the placement matrix M = T(cx,cy)·R(r° cw, y-down)·S(s·(fx?-1:1), s·(fy?-1:1))·T(-base.w/2, -base.h/2) exactly as ARCH §11.6 'Place', boxAt(item, t, canvas) (keyframe-aware via evaluate), inverse mapping and hit tests, canvas <-> normalized conversions (positions are canvas fractions with 0 = centre; text sizes in points at a 1,080 px short side). text_layout_spec.dart: TextLayoutSpec data (text, style, maxWidth px, canvas, scale), textLayoutSpecOf(item, canvas) and cueLayoutSpecOf(cue, track, canvas) (layout itself is Flutter, API-04). text_animation_eval.dart: evaluateTextAnimation(item, t, canvas) per ARCH §6.6 (ease-out cubic 1-(1-x)^3 sampled at 6 linear segments; fade, slide 10% of min(W,H) + fade, scale 0.6->1 + fade, typewriter floor(n·p) grapheme clusters via package:characters; out mirrors) returning {opacity, offset, scale, revealCount} plus breakpoints(item) for the compiler.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** matrix unit tests incl. flips, 90° rotations, crop+fit combinations; boxAt of keyframed items exact at keys; animation values exact at breakpoints; typewriter counts graphemes (emoji ZWJ, combining marks, CJK).

#### CORE-08 · Validator and repair

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-05, CORE-06
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/validate/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/validate/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/support/random_project.dart`
- **Spec:** lib/src/validate/: validate(project, {Set<TrackId>? only}) -> List<Violation> for invariants I1-I9 (ARCH §6.9, domain.md §5); repair(project) -> (EditProject, List<ProjectOpenWarning>) that never refuses: snaps edges/keys/markers to the grid, moves overlapping items to new lanes, drops dangling transitions/links/keys, clamps source ranges and speeds, restores exactly one main track, removes empty cues, fixes band order and fades. test/support/random_project.dart: seeded random valid-project generator (tracks of every kind, ramps, keys, transitions, links, cues) shared with CORE-34 and benchmarks.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** each invariant has a failing fixture and a repair test (repair output validates); incremental `only:` equals full validation on 500 random projects; full validate of 2,000 items <= 5 ms and one track <= 0.5 ms on the CI host (benchmark test with a 3x CI factor).

#### CORE-36 · Visual packing and per-platform layer counts

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-03
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/eval/visual_packing.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/eval/packing/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/vectors/packing.json`
- **Spec:** ARCH §13.5 and D-14 (review issue 3). `packVisualLayers(List<PackInput(id, z, t0, t1, decoderBacked)>) -> PackResult {seqOf(id), slotCount, peakConcurrentDecoders}`: layers in one slot never overlap in time; slots have a fixed stacking order, so two lanes share a slot only when no layer of another slot that overlaps either in time lies between them in z during the overlap; deterministic greedy first-fit in ascending z then t0; transition A/B windows take a second slot only for the overlapping layers. `packingInputsOf(project, {laneFilter})` derives the inputs from the model with the lowering rules for overlap transitions (left extended to c + d/2, right to c − d/2) so LayerLimits can run after every command without compiling, incrementally per changed lane. The compiler (CORE-30) assigns `seq` from the same function; packing.json vectors (inputs → seq, slotCount, peak) are read by IOS-08 and AND-08 tests.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** rule properties on 1,000 seeded random layer sets (no time overlap within a slot, z order preserved against every overlapping slot, determinism); six short non-overlapping PiP lanes pack into ≤ 2 slots; an interleaving case refuses to share; model-derived inputs equal the compiled layers' ranges on compile fixtures (checked again in CORE-30); incremental update of one lane at 2,000 items <= 0.5 ms (benchmark test).

#### CORE-09 · Command framework, dry run, placement and limits

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-08, CORE-36
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/edit_command.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/rejections.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/outcome.dart`

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/limits.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/composite.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/framework/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §7.1. edit_command.dart is the library declaring `sealed class EditCommand` with `part` directives for every group file of ARCH §7.2 (clip_commands, ripple, clipboard_commands, speed_commands, property_commands, keyframe_commands, text_commands, subtitle_commands, caption_commands, transition_commands, track_commands, marker_commands, project_commands, composite). This ticket is a D-33 skeleton for those part files: create `part of` placeholders with `// OWNER: CORE-xx`. Each command implements `EditOutcome applyTo(EditProject, EditContext)` and `EditPreview previewOn(...)` so no central switch exists and group tickets never edit edit_command.dart. applyCommand/dryRun share one code path; EditRejection sealed set exactly as ARCH §7.1 (data, never thrown); exceptions -> InternalInconsistency; post-step validation of changed tracks (violation -> InternalInconsistency, project unchanged); noop detection; EditContext/EditPolicy; placement.dart: nearest free lane of the same kind, creating one (D-11), clamp support; limits.dart: LayerLimits (peak concurrent decoder-backed video layers vs policy.maxConcurrentVideoLayers and packed visual sequences vs policy.maxVisualSequences, both from CORE-36's visual_packing.dart computed incrementally for the changed lanes; maxItems 5,000; 24 h) checked generically after every command -> LimitExceeded(what, limit) (D-14). CompositeCommand is atomic.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** purity (same input + seeded ids -> equal output); rejections never throw; composite all-or-nothing; both limits enforced on fixtures (incl. six sparse PiP lanes that pass the sequence cap after packing and a seventh overlapping lane that fails it); dryRun incl. limits <= 1 ms at 1,000 items (benchmark test).

#### CORE-10 · Structural clip commands and ripple

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-09, CORE-06
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/clip_commands.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/ripple.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/clip/`
- **Spec:** InsertMedia(media, track?, at, mode auto|ripple|newLane), MoveItems(ids, delta, toTrack?, ripple), TrimItem(id, edge, newTime, ripple, clamp), SplitItems(ids, at), DeleteItems(ids, ripple), DeleteGap(gap) per ARCH §7.2 and domain.md §6.2-6.3. Rules: ripple affects the edited lanes plus lanes of linked partners (D-10); non-ripple moves/inserts into occupied space go to the nearest free lane of the same kind (D-11, via placement.dart); on the main lane with ripple on, inserts and moves snap to the nearest cut; links move/split/delete together; keyframes shift/partition (keyframe_ops); fades clamp to duration/2; transitions are dropped when adjacency breaks; locked tracks reject (TrackLocked); clamp mode returns the nearest valid result in EditPreview.clampedTo; all edges on the grid; images/stills get policy.defaultImageUs.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** before/after golden tests for every command including ripple, link, lock, clamp and new-lane cases; split concatenation equals the original time map at every frame (property test); trim respects source range and 1-frame minimum; ripple never moves items on unrelated lanes.

#### CORE-11 · Duplicate, clipboard, replace, extract audio, links, selection

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-10
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/clipboard_commands.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/clipboard.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/selection.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/clipboard/`
- **Spec:** DuplicateItems, PasteItems(payload, at, preferTrack?) (cross-project paste adds pool entries and mints new ids), ReplaceMedia (keeps range/effects/keys; shortens with a notice when the new media is shorter), ExtractAudio (adds a linked audio clip with AudioRole.original sharing the ClipTimeMap and sets detachedAudio on the video clip), LinkItems/UnlinkItems; ops/clipboard.dart: copyItems -> ClipboardPayload (self-contained items + referenced pool assets + relative offsets); Cut = copy + DeleteItems in one CompositeCommand (D-16); ops/selection.dart: SelectionRules.expand (adds link partners, drops locked items), selection hints. Pastes into occupied space follow D-11.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** golden tests for each; cross-project paste mints fresh ids and imports pool entries exactly once; replace with shorter media clamps and emits EditNotice; extracted audio stays in sync at every frame (shared map); SelectionRules.expand table test.

#### CORE-12 · Speed, reverse and freeze-frame commands

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-10
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/speed_commands.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/speed/`
- **Spec:** SetSpeed(item, spec, maintainPitch): presets 0.25/0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5/2/3/4 and custom in [0.1, 10] (D-15), ramps of 2-16 points; keeps the source range and recomputes duration = max(1 frame, quantizeNearest(T)); keys scale; following items handled per domain.md §6.2 (ripple setting, D-10/D-11); linked audio gets the same spec. SetReversed(item, on) flips only the flag and references/creates the DerivedSpec.reversed(media, range) pool entry (status pending until the engine job finishes; session updates it). FreezeFrame(item, at, duration, stillMedia): splits at `at` and inserts a still (DerivedSpec.still) of `duration` with ripple on the edited lane (domain.md §6.4).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** duration math tests for every preset and ramp preset; keys scale exactly; reverse round-trips (reverse twice == original); freeze inserts at the split with ripple and correct still time; speeds outside [0.1, 10] -> InvalidValue.

#### CORE-13 · Property and keyframe commands

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-09, CORE-05
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/property_commands.dart`

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/property/`
- **Spec:** SetProperty<T>(items, key, value, at?) keyframe-aware at a quantized `at` (writes a key when the channel has keys, else the static value), SetVisual, SetAudio, SetLook (BuiltinLook | ImportedLut + intensity), SetChroma, SetMask, SetCrop, ResetTransform (clears transform keys), AddKeyframe/RemoveKeyframe/MoveKeyframe/SetKeyframeValue/ClearKeyframes. Multi-item edits produce one outcome. Value ranges from PropertyKey metadata (InvalidValue otherwise); non-keyframable keys reject keyframe commands (UnsupportedForKind); KeyframeExists on duplicates. Volume keyframes and fades apply to audio and video-with-audio clips.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** tests per command incl. multi-item, keyframe-aware writes at quantized times, every rejection, reset transform clearing keys, apply-to-all style batch (one outcome).

#### CORE-14 · Text commands

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)

- **Spec:** AddText (goes to the top free text lane at the playhead, default duration policy.defaultTextUs = 3 s, default style Figtree/48 pt/white/centre), SetText (coalesce key `text:<id>`; EmptyText rejection for whitespace-only), SetTextStyle (font id, size [8,200], bold, italic, align, colour, letterSpacing [-20,100], lineHeight [0.6,3], maxWidth, background box, stroke, shadow), SetTextAnimation (in/out kinds incl. typewriter for in only, durations clamped so in+out <= duration). Text transform edits go through SetProperty (CORE-13).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** lane selection tests; style range validation; animation duration clamping; coalescing is verified in CORE-19's session tests (provide the command-level hook here).

#### CORE-15 · Subtitle and generated-caption commands

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-10
- **Owns:**

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/commands/caption_commands.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/subtitles/`
- **Spec:** Per domain.md §6.7 and ai.md §10.2 (adopted verbatim, schema 1): AddCue (defaultCueUs 2 s, no overlap), SetCueText (sets editedAfterGeneration on generated cues; '\n' line breaks, inline <i>/<b> kept), SetCueRange (start/end timing, no overlap, >= 1 frame), SplitCue(at, textSplit?), MergeCues (adjacent cues, texts joined with a space or newline), DeleteCues, ShiftCues(track, deltaUs, range?) (re-times every cue of a track or of a range as one history entry; deltas quantized to the grid; rejects overlap with cues outside the range, clamps at 0 with a notice), ImportSubtitles(track?, cues, mode newTrack|replace) with overlapping cues spilling to a second track, SetSubtitleStyle/Position/BurnIn/Language, AddGeneratedCaptionTrack(drafts, provenance, language) and ReplaceGeneratedCaptions(track, drafts, provenance, range?) (replaceInRange replaces only overlapping cues). Both AI commands are single commands (one history entry), mint fresh ids, honour TrackLocked, set CueOrigin.generated.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** tests for every command incl. overlap rejection, ShiftCues of a whole imported track by ±2.5 s and of a range, split/merge text handling, spill on import, editedAfterGeneration set by any text or timing edit, replace-in-range boundaries, locked-track rejection as data.

#### CORE-16 · Transitions and transition limits

- **Spec:** SetTransition(ref, spec?) (null removes), ApplyTransitionToAll(trackId?, spec) as one command; kinds fade, crossDissolve, dipToBlack, dipToWhite, slide(l|r|u|d), wipe(l|r|u|d), zoom(in|out) (D-16 semantics); duration in frames centred on the cut [cut-floor(n/2), cut+ceil(n/2)). TransitionLimits.of(project, ref) -> maxFrames: all kinds <= 2·min(leftAvail, rightAvail); overlap kinds (crossDissolve, slide, wipe, zoom) also <= 2·min(leftHandle, rightHandle) with handles divided by edge speed, mirrored for reversed clips, infinite for stills/images. Transitions only on video/overlay lanes between touching neighbours.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** maxFrames tests for handles, speed, reversed clips and images; TransitionTooLong(maxFrames) rejection; NotAdjacent rejection; apply-to-all clamps per cut and is one command; edits that break adjacency drop the transition (tested with CORE-10 commands).

#### CORE-17 · Track, marker and project-setting commands, requantize

- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** band ordering enforced; main track protected; requantize properties over all 36 rate pairs on random projects (order preserved, adjacency preserved, movement bounded, result validates); marker commands round-trip.

#### CORE-18 · Snapping index

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-03
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/ops/snapping.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/ops/snapping/`
- **Spec:** SnapIndex built from a project (item edges per lane, markers, playhead, transition boundaries, optional exclusions for the dragged items): nearest(t, toleranceUs), nearestForRange(range, toleranceUs) returning the best edge pair, and snap target kinds for the UI (clip edge, marker, playhead). Commands never snap; the UI snaps the proposed time before dryRun (ARCH §7.1).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** nearest/nearestForRange correct against brute force on random sets; exclusions honoured; build <= 1 ms at 2,000 items, query <= 20 µs (benchmark test).

#### CORE-19 · EditSession: snapshot history, transactions, coalescing

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-09
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/session/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/session/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §7.3 / domain.md §7: EditSession {project, history (canUndo, canRedo, undoLabel, redoLabel, position), apply(cmd, {coalesceKey, coalesceWindow 1 s}), dryRun, begin(label) -> SessionTransaction (update applies to the base captured at begin, commit adds exactly one entry or none if unchanged, cancel restores; a second begin cancels the first), undo, redo, jump(n), applyPoolChange (sticky: imports, probe/proxy/status updates), applyPoolEdit (undoable RelinkAssets, RemoveAssets of unused assets only), updateView, retainedMedia()}. Snapshots of the Timeline root (structural sharing), pool outside snapshots, limits 200 entries or ~48 MB approximate bytes (oldest evicted), Timeline.revision and Track.changedAt are session-monotonic stamps never reused after undo, editCount counts committed entries and never decrements. Exceptions from commands become InternalInconsistency.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** undo/redo/jump identity tests; coalescing within 1 s by key; transaction update-from-base semantics; pool deltas undoable while imports stay; stamps strictly increase across undo + new edit; eviction by count and bytes; retainedMedia correct.

#### CORE-20 · SRT and WebVTT codec

Decoding order BOM -> NUL pattern (UTF-16) -> strict UTF-8 -> Windows-1252 -> Latin-1; CRLF/CR/LF. Tolerant SRT (index optional, ',' or '.', 1-3 digit fractions, > 99 h, trailing coordinates ignored); VTT requires WEBVTT, skips NOTE/STYLE/REGION, ignores cue settings, decodes entities; <i>/<b> kept and balanced, other tags and {\an8} stripped; invalid cues become issues. Serialization: half-up ms, SRT numbered from 1 with CRLF, VTT with LF, UTF-8 without BOM, blank lines in a cue collapsed, '-->' -> '->'. Suggested export name `<project>.<bcp47>.srt|vtt`. Callers run parse in Isolate.run (pure function).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** corpus in test/fixtures/subtitles (BOMs, UTF-16 LE/BE, CP1252, CJK, RTL, malformed) passes; parse(serialize(x)) == x property test; issues carry line numbers; 10k cues parse <= 100 ms.

- **Spec:** lib/src/math/: Dart implementation of every ARCH §11.6 stage on straight-alpha gamma-encoded BT.709 values (chroma key + spill, exposure, brightness/contrast, highlights/shadows, saturation, temperature/tint, LUT trilinear over .vlut tables, separable Gaussian blur with σ = blur·0.03·min(W,H) converted by scale, sharpen, vignette, mask SDF (rounded box/ellipse, feather, invert, opacity), placement matrix (must call core geometry), canvas masks, premultiplied source-over, sprite reveal, audio gain interpolation). lib/src/reference/: CPU reference renderer rendering a RenderPlan frame at time t to RGBA (small sizes, used for goldens and parity), and `audio_mix.dart`, the **Dart reference audio mixer** (ARCH §11.6 Audio row: per-sample gain envelopes 0–2, speed maps without pitch processing for analytic cases, downmix, sum, hard clip) used as the oracle by QA-11. test_fixtures/vectors/: JSON vectors for keyframe evaluation, transform M, every render-math row (input pixel -> output pixel), gain envelopes incl. 2.0 (+6.02 dB) and fades/crossfades, mixed audio windows (RMS per 20 ms) for a 3-lane reference project, typewriter reveal, and an 8× scale-keyframed text parity case; test_fixtures/images/: reference PNGs for ~30 plan fixtures × times; tool/regen_goldens.dart regenerates (review required). Joint test: core FrameRate/evaluate/boxAt pass the same vectors.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** vectors and goldens committed; reference renderer deterministic across runs; Swift/Kotlin can load vectors (format documented in test_fixtures/README.md); regen tool produces no diff on a clean tree.

#### ENG-06 · [INTEGRATION] Spike outcomes into plugin build config and Pigeon surface

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Engine (Dart)
- **Depends on:** IOS-01, AND-01, ENG-07, ENG-08
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/vwish_editor_engine.podspec`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/build.gradle.kts`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/lint.xml`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/pigeons/engine_api.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/lib/src/pigeon/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Pigeon/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Glue/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/main/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/pigeon/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/main/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/glue/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/lib/src/mobile_editor_engine.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/vectors/frame_grid.json` (the `androidSeekMsRounding` field only)
  - `docs/editor/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Spec:** [INTEGRATION] Runs only after **both extended spikes have reported** (D-42). Applies the IOS-01 and AND-01 results to files owned by ENG-01/ENG-07/ENG-08, then freezes them: podspec build settings for the precompiled Metal CI kernels (-fcikernel metallib build phase or prebuilt metallib, V-N9), any extra frameworks; build.gradle.kts/lint.xml dependency and opt-in changes; Pigeon message amendments the spikes proved necessary (with regenerated code and glue/placeholder updates); writes AND-01's measured `androidSeekMsRounding` into frame_grid.json; records V-N1..V-N6, V-N9..V-N11, V-N15..V-N25 outcomes, the Android go/no-go (R1), the measured Android `maxVisualSequences` tier values (D-14), the iOS background facts (D-22) and the preview A/V latency (§12.7) in ARCHITECTURE §5/§12.5/§13/§14.2/§24.2. On an AND-01 no-go it also activates AND-16 (ticket status) and blocks M1 exit until the owner signs off its degradations (D-43e). After this ticket the Pigeon surface is frozen; later changes need a new lead-approved [INTEGRATION] ticket.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** example app builds on both platforms with the spike regression tests ported into RunnerTests/androidTest where they exercise plugin code; ARCHITECTURE.md updated only in the sections named above; no service behaviour implemented here.

#### IOS-01 · iOS spike (day 1, spike host): Metal CI kernels, compositor, grid timing, exact seek, texture, audio tap, background encoder, reader/writer

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** iOS native
- **Depends on:** — (starts on day 1, D-42; uses self-generated media until ENG-05's fixtures land)
- **Owns:**
  - `spikes/ios_engine/`
  - `docs/editor/spikes/IOS-01.md`
- **Spec:** De-risk ARCH §13.2/§14.2 before the iOS engine is built, in a throwaway Xcode host app with XCTest under spikes/ios_engine/ (not shipped, not part of any package; kept for reference). Prove: a precompiled `-fcikernel` metallib builds inside a CocoaPods-style static library target and loads via CIKernel(functionName:fromMetalLibraryData:) on simulator and device (V-N9); AVMutableComposition + custom AVVideoCompositing with a runtime-generated spacer track + AVPlayerItemVideoOutput -> FlutterTexture-style copyPixelBuffer zero-copy; **grid timing (D-35)**: edits inserted at `CMTime(k, 30)` with cuts at frames k ≡ 1 and 2 (mod 3), compositor computing k = round(compositionTime × fps), every frame shows the expected barcode; exact seek ack 200/200 using a `vwish.frame` attachment on the iOS 26 and 18.2 simulators and on the iPhone 7 (iOS 15.8) lab device (V-N10); redraw-from-cache of the last source buffers <= 30 ms; an HLG clip arrives as SDR with supportsHDRSourceFrames = false; AVAssetReader(composition) -> AVAssetWriter export with the same compositor; **MTAudioProcessingTap** on composition audio tracks receives composition-time ranges after scaleTimeRange and gain 2.0 measures +6.02 ± 0.1 dB in AVPlayer and AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput (V-N21); **background**: on a real iPhone on iOS 18 and on iOS 26, background an export for > 30 s and record what happens (encoder error code, writer status), check that a segmented writer resumes after return, record `BGTaskScheduler.shared.supportedResources.contains(.gpu)` (V-N20, V-N11); whether the Metal CI kernels run on a `.useSoftwareRenderer` CIContext and at what speed (V-N22); preview A/V latency through a Flutter texture measured with frame timings vs audio output timestamps (V-N23). Write docs/editor/spikes/IOS-01.md with measurements and the exact podspec/build settings ENG-06 must apply.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** all spike tests green on the iOS 26 simulator and one device; grid-cut barcode case 100%; report lists V-N9, V-N10, V-N11, V-N20, V-N21, V-N22, V-N23 outcomes and required build settings.

#### AND-01 · Android spike (day 1, spike host): Media3 1.11.1 multi-sequence CompositionPlayer + Transformer, grid timing, paused edits, rebuild latency, packing

- **Milestone:** M1 · **Area:** Android native
- **Depends on:** — (starts on day 1, D-42; uses self-generated media until ENG-05's fixtures land)
- **Owns:**
  - `spikes/android_engine/`
  - `docs/editor/spikes/AND-01.md`
- **Spec:** Go/no-go for ARCH §13.3 (risk R1) in a throwaway Gradle host app with instrumented tests under spikes/android_engine/ (not shipped). Build a Composition with a transparent 2×2 clock band at fps (sequence 0, `trackTypes {VIDEO, AUDIO}`), 3 video sequences with gaps, a background solid and 2 audio-only sequences; custom GlEffects outputting canvas-size straight-alpha textures; LayerGatingCompositorSettings hiding sequences outside their layers using frameIndexNearest(pts). Answer with tests: V-N1 getOverlaySettings input id = sequence index and pts = composition time; V-N2 effect pts sequence-cumulative in CompositionPlayer and Transformer; V-N3 whether experimentalRedrawLastFrame re-runs effects on a **secondary** sequence (change an effect on sequence 2 while paused and assert the pixels change; expected no — the design no longer depends on it); V-N4 straight alpha preserved; V-N5 hdrMode tone-maps HLG; V-N6 upright frames for rotated sources; V-N15 clock band yields export fps above the source rate; V-N16 a mechanism meeting the ε source-frame rule (ARCH §11.5) at clip starts; V-N17 setFrameRate caps fast items; **V-N18 grid timing**: Media3 seek semantics (→ `androidSeekMsRounding`), clock-band pts after seeks and scrubs, secondary-frame selection, and the grid-cut barcode case (cuts at k ≡ 1, 2 mod 3 at 24/30/60 fps with boundaries anchored at P(k)) passing 100% in playback, exact seek and Transformer export; **V-N19**: setComposition → first frame with 2, 4 and 6 sequences on the 4 GB device, a PausedFrameRenderer prototype (FrameExtractor EXACT frames + the same shaders onto the surface with the player surface detached) showing a secondary-sequence effect change, and transient round-trip latency; V-N23 preview A/V latency and whether the audio sink can delay audio; V-N24 the clock band's trackTypes produce a silent AAC track in Transformer output; **V-N25** six overlay lanes of short non-overlapping PiP clips: decoder instances, GPU memory and dropped frames unpacked (6–12 sequences) vs packed (1–2 slots), from which the tier values of `maxVisualSequences` are set. Play at 30 fps at 720p on Pixel 7a and a 4 GB device; exact seek on frame_counter 200/200; Transformer exports the same composition with matching frames (SSIM >= 0.98). Write docs/editor/spikes/AND-01.md with the go/no-go, the measured numbers and the build.gradle.kts changes ENG-06 must apply; on no-go, size the AND-16 contingency precisely and list the owner bullets it degrades for sign-off (D-43e).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** report committed with every V-N item answered by a test; go/no-go decision recorded; Android structural budgets of ARCH §13.4 confirmed or renegotiated in the report.

#### AI-03 · whisper native C shim and host tests

  - `packages/vwish_whisper/src/CMakeLists.txt`
  - `packages/vwish_whisper/src/tests/`
  - `scripts/ci/editor/whisper_host.sh`
- **Spec:** ai.md §4.6: shim implementing vw_whisper.h — each job on its own std::thread; mutex-guarded status and segment buffer polled by Dart every 250 ms via leaf calls; cancel/pause as atomics read by abort_callback and encoder_begin_callback; strings copied in; model load/unload with refcounts; VAD (Silero) parameters, suppress_nst, token timestamps, language detect mode (DETECT top-3 probabilities), threads; vw_shutdown_all for hot restart; logging without segment text or paths. src/CMakeLists.txt builds the shim + ggml/whisper for host tests (Android/iOS specifics live in AI-04's android.cmake and AI-05's script). Host tests (GoogleTest or Catch2 vendored in tests/) transcribe jfk.wav with ggml-tiny (downloaded by the CI script with sha256 check, cached), cancel/pause/resume, detect, concurrent jobs. whisper_host.sh runs them on ubuntu and the self-hosted Mac, plus TSan and ASan jobs.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** all host tests pass on macOS and Linux incl. TSan and ASan (vw_job_free never leaks); grep check proves logs never contain segment text or paths.

#### AI-06 · whisper device profile, thermal/memory events, backup exclusion channel

  - `packages/vwish_whisper/android/src/test/`
  - `packages/vwish_whisper/test/device/`
- **Spec:** ai.md §4.8: method + event channel `vwish_whisper/device`: device profile (RAM, available memory via os_proc_available_memory on iOS (V-A2) / ActivityManager.MemoryInfo on Android, perf/efficiency core counts, CPU features incl. dotprod/fp16, Apple GPU family, OS version), thermal state events (nominal/fair/serious/critical mapping, unit-tested in Kotlin), low-power mode, memory warnings, app lifecycle background/foreground events, excludeFromBackup(path) (iOS URLResourceValues), and iOS beginBackgroundTask/endBackgroundTask for downloads with expiry events. Dart side parses defensively.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** Dart unit tests with malformed maps; Kotlin thermal mapping tests; manual checklist on one iOS and one Android device (recorded in the PR); excludeFromBackup verified via URLResourceValues read-back.

### M2: Persistence, RenderPlan compiler, native media services, speech core

#### CORE-22 · Project JSON codec, fragment cache, schema version

- **Milestone:** M2 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-03, CORE-04, CORE-05
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/codec/project_json.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/codec/fragment_cache.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/codec/schema_version.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/schema/project.v1.schema.json`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/codec/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §8.2 body conventions: integer µs, '#RRGGBBAA', shortest round-trip doubles, default-valued fields omitted, fixed key order (deterministic bytes), items tagged "t":"clip"|"text"|"cue", enums as lower-camel strings, unknown enum values -> default + ProjectOpenWarning; the header line model (format, schema 1, minReader 1, app, savedAt, docRevision, saveId, bodyBytes, bodySha256) is defined in schema_version.dart, written by CORE-24. FragmentCache: Expando keyed by object identity so re-encoding after a one-item edit only re-serializes changed tracks/items. schema/project.v1.schema.json is the normative body schema. ai.md provenance/origin fields are part of schema 1.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** decode(encode(p)) == p on 500 random projects (CORE-08 generator); deterministic bytes; a project using every locator kind under a fake `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<uuid>/` root encodes with no persisted string containing the container prefix (only BookmarkLocator.lastKnownPath may, as a hint; ARCH §8.2); incremental re-encode after a one-item edit <= 3 ms at 2,000 items; unknown enum -> warning not failure; encoded fixtures validate against the schema.

#### CORE-23 · Migration framework and schema fixtures

- **Milestone:** M2 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-22
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/codec/migrations/`

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/projects/s1/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/codec_migrations/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §8.5: Migrations.chain of pure, idempotent functions on raw JSON maps (s<N> -> s<N+1>) run in the decode isolate; a test-only s0 -> s1 migration exercises the framework; header-only classification (needsNewerApp when minReader > supported, readOnlyNewer when schema > supported but minReader <= supported, per D-12); LoadedProject.migratedFrom recorded; the pre-migration backup is written by the repository (CORE-25) on first save, this ticket provides `needsPreMigrationBackup`. Fixtures: every schema keeps test/fixtures/projects/s<N>/ files that must migrate, validate, re-encode and round-trip.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** s0 fixtures migrate to valid s1 projects; migrations idempotent; newer-schema detection from the header alone (body never parsed); opening never writes.

#### CORE-24 · Store filesystem, atomic writes, .vwproj format, OwnedFileDeleter

- **Milestone:** M2 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-22
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/store/store_roots.dart`

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/store/documents_export_writer.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/store/fs/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §8.1-8.3 and §9.6. StoreRoots {support, cache, documents} with editor subpaths (<support>/vwish/editor/..., <support>/vwish/speech/..., <cache>/vwish/editor/...); StoreFs abstraction with LocalStoreFs (dart:io) and FaultInjectingFs (crash after step N, ENOSPC, EACCES); AtomicFile.write: write path.tmp-<rand>, flush (fsync), rename path -> path.bak, rename tmp -> path; read order: valid path, else newest valid of tmp-*/.bak, else corrupt; vwproj_format: two-line header+body with SHA-256 over the body and bodyBytes check; OwnedFileDeleter: the only Dart delete path — canonicalizes, resolves symlinks, requires the target inside editorSupport or editorCache and outside documents, refuses external assets, throws OwnershipViolation (logged, asserted in debug, never performed); also `canConsume(tempPath)` for moving app-owned temp files (allowed only under `<cache>/vwish/editor/work/{picks,drops}/` and the engine's own outputs). DocumentsExportWriter (D-44): the only writer into Documents — target directory Documents/Exports/ only, exclusive create (O_EXCL semantics; never overwrite), `'<name> (2).mp4'` naming re-implementing vwish_data's LibraryStorage._uniqueTarget scheme, refuses symlinked targets or parents, copies from an editor-root source.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** FaultInjectingFs crash at every step always leaves a valid main, tmp or bak document; checksums detect truncation and bit flips; deleter fuzz (symlinks, '..', case variants, Unicode NFC/NFD, documents paths, external assets) never deletes outside roots; DocumentsExportWriter with a pre-existing file of the same name leaves it byte-identical (hash, size, mtime) and writes '<name> (2).mp4'; symlinked Exports dir refused; V-D1: document whether RandomAccessFile.flush() fsyncs on iOS/Android (Dart SDK source reference) — device confirmation in QA-10.

#### CORE-25 · ProjectRepository and writer isolate

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/store/repository/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/testing.dart`
- **Spec:** ARCH §8.4 interface exactly (watchSummaries, create(empty | fromMedia), open, save(EditSession, reason), requestAutosave (delegates to CORE-26 scheduler; placeholder no-op until it lands), flush, close, rename (1-80 chars), duplicate ('<name> copy', '<name> copy 2'; shares managed media), delete (atomic move to trash/ then guarded delete, then GC hook), recoverable/restore/discard (delegating to CORE-26), findUntouchedProjectFor(pathOrUri) (origin.fromPlayer fingerprint match && editCount == 0), storageReport()). FileProjectRepository: bundle layout ARCH §8.1, open = read -> migrate -> decode -> validate -> repair in Isolate.run (ProjectBusy when already open), pre-migration backup on first save, meta.json/refs.json/poster.jpg, Projects list scans projects/*/meta.json and rebuilds bad ones in an isolate; create(fromMedia) imports via MediaPoolService and derives settings (aspect snapped within 1%, fps snapped to supported integer <= 60, base short side 720/1080/2160 by source and capability, view.playhead = quantize(initialPlayhead)). Long-lived writer isolate hashes and writes; one serial queue per project, latest wins. lib/testing.dart exports InMemoryProjectRepository (uses FaultInjectingFs in memory) for UI tests.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every method tested on FaultInjectingFs; meta.json and refs.json written under a fake container root contain no container prefix and reopen under a different `<uuid>` root with zero missing media; duplicate shares managed media; delete never touches documents or external assets; fromMedia settings derivation table test; ProjectHealth (ok|needsNewerApp|readOnlyNewer|corrupt) surfaced; open of 2,000 items <= 150 ms core time (benchmark).

#### CORE-26 · Autosave scheduler, journal and crash recovery

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/store/recovery.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/store/recovery/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §8.3: autosave to the next journal slot (a/b) debounced 2 s idle and forced at 10 s, skipped while a transaction is open; manual save, app hidden/paused and editor close write main + meta + refs (+ poster) and truncate the journal; recovery = newest valid journal slot with docRevision > main.docRevision and baseSaveId == main.saveId; restore promotes atomically, discard deletes, 'Open last saved' keeps the journal as recovered-<ts> until the next successful save; LoadedProject.pendingRecovery; save failures -> SaveStatus.failed(StoreFailure) with retry on the next trigger; incremental encoding on the main isolate (<= 3 ms) and hashing/writing in the writer isolate.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** fake-clock tests for debounce/cap/transaction pause; slot alternation; crash at every write step (FaultInjectingFs) leaves a recoverable state; recovery listing only for newer journals with matching baseSaveId; disk full -> failed then retry succeeds; main-isolate block per autosave <= 2 ms at 1,000 items (benchmark).

#### CORE-27 · Media pool service, import policy, managed store, DartIoMediaAccess

  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/lib/src/store/dart_io_media_access.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/store/media/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §9.1-9.2 and D-13. FileMediaPoolService(access: MediaAccessPort, probe: Future<MediaProbe> Function(ResolvedMedia), roots, fs) implementing import(session, picked, {target}) -> List<ImportOutcome> (probe, fingerprint via access.quickHash, dedupe within a project by quickHash, locator/ownership decided by ImportPolicy per source and platform: iOS Photos pick (already cloned natively into work/picks/, ARCH §9.1) -> managed copy, iOS Files -> bookmark, Android Photo Picker/SAF -> persisted grant or managed copy when not persistable or < 32 grants remain, external drop -> managed copy, player Documents path -> AppRelativeLocator(documents), Android incoming cache copy -> managed copy, LUT -> projectOwned copy + .vlut via CORE-21, recordings/stills -> projectOwned), applied as sticky PoolChanges; ManagedStore: content-addressed media/<hh>/<quickHash>/<sanitized name>, copy (APFS clone where available, V-D8) or move only when OwnedFileDeleter.canConsume allows, excludeFromBackup on media/ and derived/; watchAvailability/checkRelink/relink/findInSameFolder are declared here and implemented by CORE-28 (delegate). DartIoMediaAccess: MediaAccessPort for plain paths (tests, desktop later).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** the ARCH §9.1 table is covered by tests against a fake port; re-picking the same file reuses its MediaId; temp copies are moved only when allowed; grant-budget fallback works; originals are never written (fs spy asserts no write/rename/delete outside editor roots).

#### CORE-28 · Availability, relink, garbage collection, backup rules

- **Spec:** ARCH §9.3-9.4, §8.1 backup, D-20. Availability states available | missing | accessLost | changed | derivedMissing, computed on open, resume and after relink (watchAvailability); checkRelink -> match (fingerprint equal, or duration ±100 ms with equal kind and dimensions) | durationMismatch | differentKind | unsupported(reason); relink(session, picks) as ONE undoable PoolEdit ('Relink media'); autoMatch(session, picks) for 'Relink several' (each pick -> best missing asset: fingerprint match first, then duration ±100 ms with equal kind and dimensions; ambiguous picks left unassigned); findInSameFolder for path locators only. GC: mark = union of refs.json of all projects + retainedMedia() of open sessions + in-flight imports/jobs; sweep unreferenced files under media/ and derived/ older than 24 h via OwnedFileDeleter and release unreferenced URI grants/bookmarks; runs 30 s after start, after project delete and from Settings > Storage; never during an export (gate callback). Android backup rules: res/xml/vwish_data_extraction_rules.xml (API 31+, cloud backup and device transfer) and vwish_backup_rules.xml (<= 30) excluding the whole files/vwish/editor and files/vwish/speech trees (ARCH §8.1: Android rules take no wildcards and recordings would exceed the 25 MB quota, failing the whole app backup); the existing player data stays included; AndroidManifest gets only android:dataExtractionRules and android:fullBackupContent attributes ([INTEGRATION] touch of the app manifest, no other edits).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every availability state and relink outcome tested with a fake port; relink is one undo step; autoMatch relinks 10 missing Photos assets from one 10-item pick and leaves ambiguous ones unassigned; GC fuzz never deletes referenced or external files and respects the grace period and export gate; V-A7: `adb shell bmgr` procedure documented in test/store/gc/README.md and run in QA-10; V-D4 checked with IOS-15.

Text items and burned subtitle cues (export target only, D-05) -> sprite layers referencing SpriteManifest entries (base from sprite size, xf from transform, cue anchoring by SubtitlePosition using sprite height, anim from evaluateTextAnimation breakpoints, typewriter -> `reveal` 0..n). sprite_requests.collectSpriteRequests(project, canvas, exportScale, {maxTextureSize}) -> content-keyed SpriteRequests (sha1 of TextLayoutSpec JSON, scale, canvas, fontsVersion) where each item's raster scale = exportScale × its maximum animated scale (static, keyframed up to 8×, text-animation scale), reduced so no side exceeds min(maxTextureSize, 2 × output long side) (ARCH §10.3). Audio: AudioSeg per clip from the same ClipTimeMap as the video layer, gain envelope = volume keys × fades × mute/solo × transition audio dips (equal-power crossfade sampled linearly), extra samples every 20 ms where products are non-linear (<= 0.1 dB error), pitch flag from maintainPitch; audio muted above capabilities.maxAudioSpeed (D-15).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** compile golden per transition kind and direction, per text animation, burn-in on/off; sprite raster scale for an 8× scale keyframe and its clamp at maxTextureSize 4096; gain envelope with volume 200% (2.0); envelope error <= 0.1 dB vs analytic; video layer and audio segment boundaries identical for every clip (A/V property test); export compile without manifest entries returns ExportBlocked.

TextSpriteRasterizer: renders text with background box, stroke, shadow to premultiplied RGBA at the per-item raster scale from CORE-31 (max animated scale, clamped to maxTextureSize and 2× the output long side) plus the u16 glyph-order map for typewriter (grapheme clusters). VspriteCodec: 'VSPR' v1 encode/decode (zlib in Isolate.run). SpritePrepass: run(List<SpriteRequest>, cacheDir) rasterizes missing sprites in <= 4 ms UI-thread slices, writes <cache>/vwish/editor/sprites/<key>.vsprite, reports progress, returns SpriteManifest; content-addressed reuse.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** glyph boxes equal ui.Paragraph boxes; RTL, CJK and emoji fixtures render with system fallback (V-A11: document Figtree coverage and fallback); reveal map correct for grapheme clusters; codec round-trip; per-slice UI time <= 4 ms; V-D7: 1,000 cues prepared <= 8 s on a mid device (measured in QA-04; host benchmark here).

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Probe/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §15 row 'Probe / compatibility' and §12.5. Probe via AVURLAsset async loads (duration, tracks, isPlayable, isComposable, hasProtectedContent), format descriptions (codec, bit depth, transfer -> ColorTransfer, nominal fps + VFR detection), preferredTransform -> rotation and display size, audio streams/channels/sample rate, size; compatibility(uri) <= 300 ms: Dart-side container sniff happens first (UX), natively MKV/WebM/AVI -> NotEditable('container_unsupported_ios'), protected/non-composable -> NotEditable with codes. DeviceProfile: RAM, chip family, tier table (minimal < 3 GB: A9–A11 iPhone 6s/7/8/SE 1st gen, D-40; low 3 GB: iPhone X/SE 2; mid 4-6 GB; high >= 8 GB or A15+ with 6 GB), thermal state, low-power mode. Capabilities: H.264/HEVC hardware probe — under `#available(iOS 17.4, *)` with kVTVideoEncoderSpecification_RequireHardwareAcceleratedVideoEncoder / kVTCompressionPropertyKey_UsingHardwareAcceleratedVideoEncoder at target sizes; below 17.4 device encoders count as hardware and HEVC is detected with AVOutputSettingsAssistant(preset: .hevc1920x1080) != nil plus a VTCompressionSession create and one-frame test encode at the target size (simulator: software H.264 only) —, movContainer true, maxExportSize/maxFpsByHeight by tier (minimal: 1080p H.264), maxConcurrentVideoLayers 2/3/4/6, maxVisualSequences 16, maxTextureSize 16384, maxPreviewLongSide 640/960/1280/1920, proxiesRecommended forced on minimal, lowMemoryDevice on minimal, backgroundKind honestly per device (`continued` only on iPad iOS 26+ when `BGTaskScheduler.shared.supportedResources.contains(.gpu)` and the entitlement is present; `paused` on every iPhone, D-22), backgroundGpu, voiceRecording, holdFrame, fpsUpconversion, externalDrop, speeds 0.1/10/4, maxLutSize 65, planVersions [1]; supported requires a Metal device.

#### IOS-17 · iOS segmented writer, checkpoint, passthrough concat and job interruption

- **Milestone:** M2 · **Area:** iOS native

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Core/JobInterruption.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Segments/`
- **Spec:** D-22 and ARCH §14.2 (review issue 4): AVAssetWriter loses its encoder in the background and cannot resume, so every long reader/writer job is segment-resumable. SegmentedWriter: closed-GOP video segments of N seconds of output (default 10 s; each its own AVAssetWriter file starting with an IDR, identical encoder settings), an optional whole-duration audio file, atomic SegmentCheckpoint after each finished segment (job kind, input hash, encode settings, completed segments with durations), resume from the next segment start (callers re-create their reader with `timeRange`). SegmentConcat: passthrough (AVAssetReader with nil output settings per segment → one AVAssetWriter input with the first segment's format description as sourceFormatHint; SPS/PPS equality asserted, otherwise the mismatching segment is re-encoded), audio muxed passthrough, each segment deleted after it is appended (peak disk ≈ output + one segment). JobInterruption: observes didEnterBackground/willEnterForeground; on background it stops registered jobs immediately (in-progress segment discarded), keeps checkpoints and reports interruption; on foreground it re-queues them; on a cold start it exposes resumable checkpoints (used by IOS-13's `activeJobs()` → resumable).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** a segmented H.264 export of frame_counter interrupted at random points (simulated by failing the writer with AVFoundationErrorDomain −11847) resumes and concatenates to a file whose barcodes, frame count and PTS equal an uninterrupted export; concat output passes the §14.4 container checks; peak disk measured; checkpoint survives process kill; SPS/PPS mismatch path tested.

WaveformService: `.vwpk` int8 min/max at 200 pairs/s per audio stream, cached in DiskCache waves/. SpeechAudioExtractor (ai.md §7.2, D-28 port implemented natively): 16 kHz s16 mono WAV for a source range, fixed downmix (mono copy; stereo 0.5/0.5; 5.1 -> 0.5·C + 0.25·(L+R) + 0.125·(Ls+Rs), LFE dropped) + AVAudioConverter (.high), written to the Dart-supplied path; cancel deletes partial output; unsupported codecs -> unsupportedMedia.

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Proxy/`
- **Spec:** JobRegistry: job ids, priorities (interactive > export-blocking > background), concurrency (1 on minimal/low tier, 2 otherwise), pre-emption by export and interactive jobs, progress events <= 4 Hz, cancellation cleaning `.part` outputs, waveform/proxy/reverse/freeze/speechAudio kinds, and IOS-17's JobInterruption semantics (backgrounding stops every reader/writer job, keeps completed segments/chunks and re-queues it on foreground, D-22). ProxyJob: 540p short side H.264 3 Mbps, GOP 10 frames, SDR (HDR tone-mapped), AAC 128k, identical PTS to the source (VFR preserved), reader -> IOS-17 SegmentedWriter -> concat into `.part` + rename into <cache>/vwish/editor/proxies/<quickHash>-540.mp4. ProxyRegistry: status by fingerprint, LRU cap min(4 GB, 10% free).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** proxy PTS equal to source PTS on the VFR fixture (also across a resumed segment boundary); size/GOP verified with AVAsset inspection; pre-emption and cancel tests; HDR source -> SDR proxy; a simulated background interruption mid-proxy resumes from the last segment.

- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Media/ReverseJob.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Reverse/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §15 'Reverse' (review issue 14): process the range in GOP-aligned chunks (≈ 2 s of source) **from the end**: each chunk is transcoded to an all-intra H.264 intermediate in <cache>/vwish/editor/work/ and read back with AVAssetReaderTrackOutput (supportsRandomAccess = true, reset(forReadingTimeRanges:), 420v output) in reverse frame order — no second copy of the intermediate, and the intermediate never exceeds one chunk — then encoded with mirrored PTS into the Dart-supplied derived/<specHash>.mp4; audio reversed in 64k-frame blocks -> AAC; preflight refuses ranges > 10 min (LimitExceeded('reverseRange')) and checks freeBytes >= 2 × estimated output + one chunk + 64 MB (diskFull); resumes from the last complete chunk after a background interruption (IOS-17 JobInterruption); progress and cancel via JobRegistry.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** barcode strictly decreasing; duration = range ± 1 frame; click positions mirrored ±20 ms; peak work-dir size <= one chunk intermediate + output; peak memory delta <= 90 MB at 4K and <= 40 MB at 1080p (3 decoded 420v frames + codec working sets); preflight refusals tested; cancel removes work files; interruption resume keeps the barcode sequence continuous.

#### IOS-18 · iOS audio gain tap (sample-exact envelopes up to +6 dB) and ramp-seam crossfade

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/AudioTap/`
- **Spec:** D-37 (review issues 5, 21): MTAudioProcessingTap (`audioTapProcessor` on AVMutableAudioMixInputParameters) that multiplies every sample by the track's gain envelope (plan `gain`, linear, 0–2) evaluated at the composition time of each sample (from the tap's source time range), with an atomically swappable TapEnvelope so gain-only patches never rebuild the item; works in AVPlayerItem.audioMix and AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput.audioMix; setVolumeRamp is not used. Ramp-seam option: when QA-11's click test (or this ticket's) shows discontinuities at speed-ramp segment seams, CompositionBuilder (IOS-08) alternates ramp segments across two audio tracks and this tap applies 5 ms equal-power crossfades at each seam (API: `TapEnvelope.withSeamCrossfades(seams)`).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** gain vectors from API-03 reproduced sample-exactly on rendered PCM (±0.01 dB); 200% vs 100% on tone_1khz measures +6.02 ± 0.1 dB in both AVPlayer (offline render via AVAudioEngine manual rendering of the player item or reader output) and AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput (V-N21); envelope swap is glitch-free (no sample discontinuity > −60 dBFS); fades and volume keyframes match the Dart reference mixer within ±0.5 dB per 20 ms window; ramp-seam click test on a 7-point ramp with keep-pitch: no seam transient > −40 dBFS above the tone envelope (or the crossfade option enabled and passing).

DefaultPlanCompiler implements UX-08's PlanCompilerPort with core compileRenderPlan/PlanMemo in Isolate.run above 300 items and an AssetResolver over the session pool, proxies and availability. Root pubspec: add vwish_editor and vwish_editor_engine path deps and the integration_test dev dependency. lib/main.dart: on iOS/Android construct MobileEditorEngine and merge EditorBootstrap overrides; desktop unchanged. app_router.dart: routes /projects and /editor/:projectId?t= (redirect to / unless EditorAvailability.platform is supported and VWISH_EDITOR; unknown id handled by the screen), explicit /settings/editor child route (not a SettingsDestination value), Home onOpenEditor and Settings onOpenEditorSettings wired only when available; StorageContributor registry override with EditorStorageContributor.

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Composition/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Composition/`
- **Spec:** Implements ARCH §11 (which overrides native.md §4.2: flat lowered layers, no lanes, no transition code) and §13.2 'Composition' and 'Audio'. Plan/: JSONDecoder models for RenderPlan/Patch/Transient v1 (unknown keys ignored), validator mirroring ARCH §11.3, ParamSnapshot (immutable per-layer params incl. evaluated anim channels), patch classification matching test/fixtures/render_plans/classification.json, keyframe evaluation matching API-03 vectors. Composition/: CompositionBuilder on previewControlQueue (one AVURLAsset per media with precise timing, loadTracks; media layers placed on the composition video track named by their `seq` (CORE-36 packing); per map segment insertTimeRange(srcRange shifted +500 µs per D-04, at: CMTime(k0, gridFps)) + scaleTimeRange to CMTime(k1 − k0, gridFps) — grid times are never converted to µs CMTimes (D-35); a 16×16 one-frame spacer generated at runtime with AVAssetWriter into <cache>/vwish/editor/engine/spacer_16x16_v1.mov when missing, scaled across CMTime(0…K, gridFps)), InstructionBuilder (VWInstruction per layer boundary with CMTime(k, gridFps) ranges, bottom -> top, required source track ids, isValid in debug), AVMutableVideoComposition (customVideoCompositorClass, frameDuration 1/fps, BT.709), audio segments interval-coloured × pitch with AVMutableAudioMixInputParameters (.spectral or .varispeed) and IOS-18's GainTap carrying the gain envelope (no setVolumeRamp, D-37); gain-only patches swap the tap envelope; when IOS-18's ramp-seam option is enabled, ramp segments alternate across two audio tracks; security-scoped bookmark access refcounted per session.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every contract fixture decodes and re-encodes equal; all fixtures build valid compositions; every grid-aligned edit point, scaled duration and instruction range is an exact CMTime(k, gridFps) and source ranges equal the plan's µs; on grid_cuts_30fps.json the instruction found at CMTime(k, 30) for every frame k matches expected_active.json; frame-grid, packing and keyframe vectors pass; tap envelopes equal the plan gain envelopes; a no-audio plan builds a composition with no audio tracks without exceptions; classification vectors pass; build of a 2,000-item plan <= 150 ms (mid).

- **Spec:** Metal Core Image kernels (compiled per IOS-01/ENG-06 settings) implementing ARCH §11.6 in D-08 order: vw_look (crop sampling, chroma + spill, grade, LUT via tiled 2D texture with trilinear sampling), vw_blur_h/vw_blur_v (separable Gaussian, σ in plan-canvas px scaled to render px), vw_sharpen, vw_vignette_mask (vignette + mask SDF), vw_cmask (canvas masks), vw_reveal (sprite glyph-order threshold), vw_matte (chroma matte preview). Kernels.swift wraps them as CIFilter-like functions with colour management off. LutStore loads .vlut (D-07) into tiled textures (N tiles of N×N in a ceil(sqrt N) grid). SpriteStore decodes .vsprite (zlib premultiplied RGBA + reveal map). ImageLayerCache: decoded images/solids at render scale.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every render-math vector from API-03 passes on 8×8 images through a software CIContext and on the simulator GPU within the ARCH §11.6 tolerance; LUT of size 2, 33, 65 load; sprite fixtures from API-04 decode; per-kernel timing logged.

ParamSnapshot swapped atomically, never locked during a render; generation counter cancellation. RedrawCache keeps the last request's source buffers so param patches, transients, editing modes (normal, cropSource(item), matte(item)) and look stills render on the same path while paused (<= 30 ms). Export variant parameters (render size = output, frameDuration = 1/export fps) supported.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** render parity vs API-03 reference goldens for every golden plan within tolerance (simulator, recorded for device in QA-03), including the 8× scale-keyframed text sprite; grid_cuts_30fps.json renders the expected layers at every frame; compose <= 8 ms mid at 1080p with 2 layers + LUT + sprite; redraw-from-cache <= 30 ms; matte and cropSource modes; typewriter reveal; cancellation works.

- **Spec:** ARCH §11 (overrides native.md §4.2) and §13.3 'Sequence stack', 'Items', 'Compositing'. plan/: android.util.JsonReader decoding of RenderPlan/Patch/Transient v1 (unknown keys ignored), validator mirroring §11.3, ParamSnapshot, classification vectors, keyframe evaluation vectors. composition/: CompositionMapper building the multi-sequence Composition (0 = transparent clock band at the output fps built with trackTypes {VIDEO, AUDIO} so a silent audio track always exists, D-38; one video sequence per CORE-36 `seq` slot, ordered top -> bottom, trackTypes {VIDEO}, padded with gaps; background solid; audio-only sequences per interval colour with trackTypes {AUDIO}; no deprecated force-track setters), **every item and gap boundary anchored at P(k) = round(k·1e6/gridFps)** (durations as differences of P; media clipping end adjusted by ≤ 1 µs × rate, D-35), MediaItem ClippingConfiguration from maps with the ε mechanism chosen in AND-01, setRemoveAudio for video, SegmentSpeedProvider(map) with keepPitch, items faster than 1× capped at the project fps with setFrameRate (V-N17), image items with duration and frame rate, GainProcessor(KeyframedGainProvider) sample-exact envelopes (0–2), LayerGatingCompositorSettings (k = frameIndexNearest(pts); alphaScale 0 when no layer of the sequence covers timeOfFrame(k)), Composition.setHdrMode(tone map OpenGL), composition audio Sonic(48 kHz) + ChannelMixing(stereo); every file opts in with @OptIn(UnstableApi::class, ExperimentalApi::class); per-layer effect lists [LayerLookEffect, SeparableBlurEffect?, LayerPlaceEffect] referencing AND-09 classes (placeholders until then); content:// read-only access.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every contract fixture maps; sequence durations equal durUs and every cumulative item/gap boundary equals P(k) exactly (frame_grid vectors at 24/25/30/48/50/60); on grid_cuts_30fps.json gating at P(k) matches expected_active.json for every frame; packing vectors honoured (sequence count = slot count); a no-audio plan still yields an audio track; z-order and gating unit tests; SegmentSpeedProvider integrates to plan durations ±1 µs; gain envelope sample-exact vs vectors; classification vectors pass; 2,000-item mapping <= 150 ms mid.

#### AND-09 · Android GL effects, shaders, LUT and sprite textures

- **Milestone:** M3 · **Area:** Android native

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/effects/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §13.3 'GL effects' and §11.6 math in GLSL ES 1.00: LayerLookEffect (vw_look.glsl: crop via texcoords, chroma + spill, grade, LUT tiled sampler, matte flag; configure returns min(source, render size ÷ (item scale × max animated scale)) so 4K sources downscale first without softening keyframed zooms), SeparableBlurEffect (only when blur > 0 at any time), LayerPlaceEffect (vw_place.glsl: sharpen, vignette, mask SDF, inverse-mapped placement matrix, opacity, canvas masks, 1 px antialiased edges; outputs canvas-render-size straight-alpha texture), SpriteBandEffect (export: sprite quads with M and reveal map from .vsprite), LUT (.vlut) and sprite texture loaders; params read from AtomicReference<ParamSnapshot> at drawFrame(ptsUs) with k = frameIndexNearest(ptsUs); **early exit**: when timeOfFrame(k) is outside the sequence's layers every effect clears to transparent and skips sampling, LUT and blur (review issue 3); sprite textures respect maxTextureSize; only the vwish-gl thread touches GL (assertion); resources released on effect release. The shader programs are exposed through a small `ShaderPrograms` API so AND-17's PausedFrameRenderer reuses them.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** render-math vectors and parity goldens (API-03) pass on the API 35 emulator within tolerance, incl. the 8× scale-keyframed case; a gated frame costs one clear (GL timer query); GL leak test; 1080p compose <= 8 ms mid (GL timer query, recorded in QA-04).

#### AND-17 · Android paused-frame renderer, layer GL compositor and structural debounce

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/paused/`
- **Spec:** D-36 (review issue 2): Media3 redraws only input 0 while paused and setComposition rebuilds every player, so paused editing never goes through the player. LayerCompositorGl: renders a list of per-layer source textures through AND-09's shader programs (LayerLook, optional blur, LayerPlace) into canvas-render-size targets and blends them premultiplied source-over onto the background, bottom -> top, on the vwish-gl thread. PausedFrameRenderer: on pause and after each exact seek settles, prefetches EXACT frames (AND-06 SourceFrameCache / FrameExtractor) of the media layers active at timeOfFrame(k) (cancelled by play or seek); while paused, any param patch, transient, editing mode (normal, cropSource, matte) or structural edit renders the current plan + transients at frame k through LayerCompositorGl onto the SurfaceProducer with the player surface detached (the showSourceFrame mechanism); extracting only newly needed layers for structural edits; reattaches the player surface on play or seek. StructuralDebouncer: coalesces structural patches (150 ms trailing, 600 ms max wait) and runs setComposition in the background, swapping to the player surface on its first frame when playing.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** pixels of the paused frame match the player's composed frame for the same plan within the ARCH §11.6 parity tolerance; changing an effect on a secondary sequence while paused updates the frame (the case Media3 redraw misses); transient round trip <= 2 frames mid after prefetch; paused structural edit visible <= 250 ms mid / 400 ms low; debounce coalesces 10 structural patches in 1 s into <= 3 rebuilds; GL resources released on dispose.

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/integration_test/android_preview_test.dart`
- **Spec:** ARCH §13.3 'Session' and §12.7: PreviewSession hosts a `PreviewBackend` interface (CompositionPlayer backend here; AND-16's multi-player backend only on an AND-01 no-go). CompositionPlayer built with MultipleInputVideoGraph.Factory (WORKING_COLOR_SPACE_ORIGINAL; no replayable cache, D-36), own GL executor and preview HandlerThread, audio focus; SurfaceBridge over TextureRegistry.createSurfaceProducer(resetInBackground) with onSurfaceCleanup detach (main thread waits <= 500 ms on a latch; preview thread never waits on main) and onSurfaceAvailable reattach + redraw; clock polled at 10 Hz with seq; exact seek to P(k) rounded to ms per frame_grid.json's androidSeekMsRounding, acked on the first onVideoFrameAboutToBeRendered with frameIndexNearest(pts) == k (500 ms timeout -> ack actual; D-35); scrubbing mode while dragging; **paused edits go through AND-17's PausedFrameRenderer** (param patches, transients, editing modes and structural edits while paused; experimentalRedrawLastFrame is not used, D-36); **structural patches go through AND-17's StructuralDebouncer** (150 ms trailing, 600 ms max wait), then setComposition(c, positionMs) while the paused frame (or, during playback, the last frame) stays on screen; quality (resize producer + rebuild), thermal SEVERE forces <= half; look stills, sampleColor and trim-edge frames via FrameExtractor EXACT with LayerLookEffect overrides; PreviewSessionManager suspends the session during export on minimal/low/mid tiers. On an AND-01 no-go this ticket ships the shell and PreviewBackend interface, and its playback acceptance criteria are met through AND-16.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** example integration test through MobileEditorEngine with the IOS-11 acceptance list (seq, exact ack 200/200 incl. every frame around the grid_cuts cuts at 24/30/60 fps, scrub coalescing, transient <= 2 frames while paused, param patch <= 30 ms mid) and the renegotiated Android structural budgets of ARCH §13.4 (paused structural edit visible <= 250 ms mid / 400 ms low; playback-ready <= 600 ms mid / 1,000 ms low with <= 4 sequences); preview A/V offset <= 1 frame and <= 40 ms after compensation (V-N23); resetInBackground surface loss recovers, latch never > 500 ms, rebuild keeps the last frame.

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/fallback/`
- **Spec:** Built only if AND-01 records a no-go (ENG-06 activates it); otherwise closed as 'not needed' with AND-01's report attached, like UX-43. ARCH §13.3 'Contingency' (review issue 8): a `MultiPlayerBackend` implementing AND-10's PreviewBackend with one ExoPlayer per packing slot rendering into a SurfaceTexture (OES texture) and one per audio slot (same speed and gain processors), composited by AND-17's LayerCompositorGl on a frame clock at the project fps (Choreographer-driven), which also sets the audio master clock; drift > ½ frame corrects by seeking the late player; gaps and gating follow the plan (no Media3 composition). Export stays on Transformer (AND-11). Sizing: about 1,200–1,500 lines, ~3 weeks of the Android lane (schedule impact recorded by ENG-06). Known degradations for the owner's sign-off before M1 ends (D-43e): on minimal and low tiers more than 2 simultaneous video layers play from paused-exact still frames during playback; exact seek latency +30%.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests (when built):** AND-10's playback acceptance list passes through this backend; transitions (cross dissolve, slide, wipe, zoom) and video-over-video PiP play in real time at 30 fps on the mid device with <= 2% dropped; A/V offset <= 1 frame over 10 min; frame-grid and grid-cut barcode cases pass.

- **Spec:** ai.md §4.7: library_loader (iOS DynamicLibrary.process(); Android picks libvwish_whisper_v82.so when HWCAP has asimddp+fphp, else baseline; x86_64 baseline; ABI version check); WhisperRuntime.open() (unsupported on desktop / armeabi-v7a), WhisperModel load/unload with refcounting (released 60 s after the last job, immediately on low memory), WhisperJob (transcribe or detect) polling status and segments every 250 ms with leaf FFI calls, cancel/pause/resume, progress, typed errors; never blocks the UI isolate inside FFI; vw_shutdown_all on hot restart.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** runtime tests with fake bindings; on device, transcribing jfk.wav through the Dart API matches the host test text; hot restart during a job leaves no orphan thread; poll cost < 0.5 ms p95 (trace).

#### UX-04 · Storage contributors, Settings row and Editor settings screen

VwishSettingsScreen gets an optional onOpenEditorSettings callback that shows a 'Video editor' row (null hides it); no SettingsDestination enum change (routes are explicit, INT-02). vwish_editor: EditorStorageContributor ('Video editor projects' bytes from storageReport, opens Projects, no clear; 'Editor cache' clears thumbnails/waveforms/proxies/sprites/looks, disabled while a session or job is active, never touches projects); EditorSettingsScreen (proxy media Auto/Always/Off, default preview quality, centre playhead on touch, snapping haptics, default new-project aspect, and a slot for UX-38's captions section).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** storage screen shows contributors with correct clear semantics (fake contributors); cache clear never deletes project files (core test double asserts); settings row hidden when callback null; editor settings persisted in prefs; matrix tests no overflow.

Calls engine.picker.pick then mediaPoolService.import / repository.create(fromMedia).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** widget tests with fakes for success, partial failure, cancel mid-copy (partial file deleted), free-space refusal, unsupported files, iOS-only hint; matrix tests.

EditorScreen(projectId, initialPlayhead, onClose, onOpenProjects) takes navigation callbacks from the router (INT-02).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** layout planner unit matrix over all ARCH §17.9 sizes × text scales × keyboard insets (no region below its minimum, ladder deterministic); widget tests for each layout with placeholders; back-order tests; V-U3 recorded: on the iOS simulator the edge back-swipe does not pop the editor (PopScope(canPop: false)), or the documented fallback is applied and tested.

The editor-level Shortcuts scope overrides Flutter's defaults outside EditableText: Space/Enter -> playPause instead of ActivateIntent, arrow keys -> frame/edit-point navigation instead of DirectionalFocusIntent (ARCH §17.6); V-U5 recorded on the iPad Pro simulator with a hardware keyboard.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every binding tested on iOS-, Android- and macOS-targeted platforms (debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride); **after tapping a tool tile** (so it holds focus) Space toggles playback and does not press the tile, and ←/→ step one frame instead of moving focus; inside a text field Space/arrows edit text and ⌘S still saves; focus guard tests; sheet lists exactly the registry; disabled actions explain why; V-U5 result recorded (certified on the iPad simulator by QA-00 scenario 12 in QA-01).

- **Depends on:** ENG-06
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/lib/src/mobile_export.dart`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/test/export/`
- **Spec:** MobileExportService implements ExportService: preflight(plan, encode) (warnings: software encoder, HEVC unavailable, background pauses, layers vs resolution, portrait size refused), start(plan, encode, outputPath, title, whenDetached) -> ExportJob (progress stream <= 4 Hz with phase, frames, backgrounded/pausedInBackground, warnings; result ExportResult; cancel), resume(jobId) for iOS segment-resumable jobs, activeJobs() reattaching running jobs after a hot restart or app relaunch and reporting one-shot `interrupted`, `resumable(jobId, doneFraction)` and `completedWhileDetached(result, savedToGallery)` records (consumed with consumeJobRecord; D-22, D-39).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** mocked-channel tests for progress mapping, cancel, failure codes, reattach, interrupted, resumable and completed-while-detached reporting (each reported exactly once); contract kit export section passes.

#### IOS-12 · iOS export pipeline: reader/writer, encoder settings, coordinator

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Export/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §14.2: AVAssetReader(composition) with AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput (export variant) and — only when plan.audio is non-empty — AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput (LPCM Float32 48 kHz stereo, .spectral, IOS-18 gain taps); with no audio segments the audio pump writes silent LPCM across [0, durUs) and never constructs a mix output over zero tracks (D-38); samples clamped to [−1, 1] before the AAC input; video written through IOS-17's SegmentedWriter (10 s closed-GOP segments + checkpoint, concat at the end) feeding AVAssetWriter (.mp4 or .mov, shouldOptimizeForNetworkUse) with H.264 High AutoLevel or HEVC Main AutoLevel (hvc1), AverageBitRate, ExpectedSourceFrameRate, MaxKeyFrameIntervalDuration, BT.709 colour, AAC-LC 48 kHz stereo; no location metadata; serial pump queues with requestMediaDataWhenReady; progress = last video PTS / duration; preflight (software encoder, HEVC availability at size with the pre-17.4 path of IOS-02, layer count vs resolution, free space incl. one segment); on encoderSizeLimit or a refused portrait size, one retry with a landscape-encoded buffer and preferredTransform rotation, then encoderSizeLimit (ARCH §14.1); cancel deletes the partial file and all segments; thermal critical pauses pumps; ExportCoordinator owns jobs (one at a time) and suspends preview on minimal/low/mid tiers through IOS-11's PreviewSessionManager.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** MP4 and MOV, H.264 (simulator) and HEVC (device) outputs pass conformance checks (container, codec tag, size, fps, frame count ±1, AAC 48 kHz stereo, bitrate ±25%); **conformance fixtures with no audio, with every clip muted or soloed out, and with images/text only** each produce a silent AAC 48 kHz stereo track and never crash; an export plan with gridFps 30 and fps 24 passes; A/V offset <= 1 frame and <= 20 ms on clap_flash; 200% volume measures +6.02 ± 0.1 dB in the output; cancel cleans up; encoder failures map to encoderUnavailable/encoderSizeLimit; the portrait retry path is exercised with an injected refusal.

#### IOS-14 · iOS voice recorder

- **Milestone:** M4 · **Area:** iOS native
- **Depends on:** ENG-03
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Recording/VoiceRecorder.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Recording/`
- **Spec:** ARCH §15 'Voice recording', D-25: AVAudioEngine input tap -> WAV PCM s16 48 kHz mono at the Dart path, levels at 20 Hz, start latency reported, session .playAndRecord + .defaultToSpeaker + Bluetooth HFP, interruptions/route changes stop and keep the file, permission via AVAudioApplication.requestRecordPermission (17+) / AVAudioSession (15-16), openSettings; preview playback muted while recording; previous audio session restored.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** WAV format verified; levels stream; interruption keeps a valid file; permission flows on the iPhone 8 lab device (iOS 16.7, AVAudioSession path) and on an iOS 18+ simulator (AVAudioApplication path) — no iOS 15/16 simulator runtimes exist for Xcode 26.6 (D-41); latency value plausible (< 100 ms on device).

#### IOS-15 · iOS pickers, media access (bookmarks), permissions, background guard

- **Milestone:** M4 · **Area:** iOS native

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Platform/BackgroundGuard.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Platform/`
- **Spec:** PHPickerViewController (preferredAssetRepresentationMode .current, multi-select, video/image filters; inside NSItemProvider.loadFileRepresentation's completion handler — before it returns, because the system then deletes the file — the temp file is cloned with clonefile (copy fallback) into <cache>/vwish/editor/work/picks/<uuid>/<name> and that path is returned with isTemporaryCopy = true; Dart hashes and moves it into media/, ARCH §9.1) and UIDocumentPickerViewController (asCopy false; video, audio, image, .cube via public.data + extension check, srt/vtt) returning PickedMedia with bookmarks for Files; MediaAccess: createBookmark/resolveBookmark (stale refresh), refcounted startAccessingSecurityScopedResource, stat, quickHash (same algorithm as core, streamed read), excludeFromBackup (NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey), remainingGrantBudget (unbounded on iOS); Permissions (notifications N/A, microphone status); BackgroundGuard: beginBackgroundTask lease with pause semantics. No NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription needed.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** HEVC pick without transcode (.current); the returned work/picks file still exists after the completion handler returned and a 1 s delay; bookmark survives app relaunch (V-D3, re-verified in QA-10); excluded-from-backup flag set on a directory and readable back (V-D4); quickHash equals core fixtures; lease begin/end/expiry events.

### M5: Export UI, auto captions, media health, player entry, legal, platform declarations

#### INT-03 · [INTEGRATION] iOS app declarations: Info.plist, entitlements, privacy manifest, BG task ids

- **Milestone:** M5 · **Area:** Integration
- **Depends on:** INT-01, IOS-13, IOS-14, IOS-15
- **Owns:**
  - `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
  - `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`
  - `ios/Runner/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
  - `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
  - `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`
- **Spec:** [INTEGRATION] ARCH §20.4: NSMicrophoneUsageDescription and NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription strings exactly as written there; BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers = [com.vecvel.vwish.export.*] plus any background mode IOS-13 proved necessary (V-N12); NO NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription; Runner.entitlements with com.apple.developer.background-tasks.continued-processing.gpu behind a build setting (VWISH_BG_GPU_ENTITLEMENT, off until Apple grants it), referenced via CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS in project.pbxproj (second integration touch after INT-01); Runner PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy (NSPrivacyTracking false, no collected data types, required-reason APIs the app itself uses) added to the Runner target; AppDelegate.swift only if BG task registration must happen at launch (keep the FlutterImplicitEngineDelegate structure).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** `flutter build ipa --no-codesign` succeeds; plist/entitlement/privacy-manifest validation (plutil, Xcode privacy report) clean; microphone and add-to-Photos prompts show the new strings on the simulator; on an iPhone the export reports `paused` and resumes (D-22); continued-processing export starts on an iOS 26 iPad with background GPU when entitled (or the fallback is recorded).

#### INT-04 · [INTEGRATION] App wiring v2: auto captions service, adapters, player Edit, licences route

- **Milestone:** M5 · **Area:** Integration
- **Depends on:** INT-02, AI-13, UX-38, UX-41, UX-42, ENG-03, ENG-04
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor/lib/src/app/adapters/`
  - `lib/main.dart`
  - `lib/router/app_router.dart`
  - `pubspec.yaml`
  - `test/editor_wiring_test.dart`
  - `test/privacy_policy_host_test.dart`
- **Spec:** [INTEGRATION] Adapters (D-28): EngineSpeechAudioExtractor (vwish_transcription SpeechAudioExtractor -> engine.jobs.extractSpeechAudio) and EngineBackgroundLeaseProvider (-> engine.background); root pubspec adds vwish_transcription and vwish_whisper; main.dart constructs TranscriptionServiceImpl (model store roots under <support>/vwish/speech, adapters, governor signals from engine.signals and vwish_whisper device events) and registers LicenseRegistry entries for whisper.cpp/ggml, OpenAI Whisper weights, Silero VAD, Media3 and content fonts; app_router: player route passes onEditVideo -> EditorLauncher.openFromPlayer when available, explicit /settings/licenses route to VwishLicensesScreen and About onOpenLicenses; storage registry adds SpeechStorageContributor. test/privacy_policy_host_test.dart asserts the privacy policy text contains SpeechModelSpec.host and its CDN host and an `HttpOverrides` spy test proves zero network access before consent (the real TranscriptionServiceImpl driven through the Auto captions flow up to the consent view opens no HttpClient request before UserConsent.accepted; the first request afterwards targets huggingface.co; ARCH §20.3).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** wiring test boots the app with fakes and reaches Auto captions, licences and player Edit; privacy host and no-network-before-consent tests green; macOS-targeted widget and route test (D-17): no Edit in the player top bar or more sheet, no 'E' shortcut line, no speech storage contributor; app builds on iOS (with xcframework) and Android; desktop unaffected.

#### IOS-13 · iOS background export, active-export store, Photos and Files handoff

- **Milestone:** M5 · **Area:** iOS native
- **Depends on:** IOS-12
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Export/BackgroundExecution.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Export/ActiveExportStore.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Platform/PhotosSaver.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/ios/Classes/Platform/FileHandoff.swift`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/ios/RunnerTests/Background/`
- **Spec:** D-22, D-39 and ARCH §14.2 'Background' (review issues 4, 7): BackgroundExecution decides `backgroundKind` per device — iPhone: `paused` (on didEnterBackground the export stops, IOS-17 keeps the checkpoint, progress reports pausedInBackground; on return `resume(jobId)` continues from the last complete segment automatically); iPad on iOS 26+ with `BGTaskScheduler.shared.supportedResources.contains(.gpu)` and the GPU entitlement: `continued` (BGContinuedProcessingTaskRequest('com.vecvel.vwish.export.<jobId>', title, subtitle), strategy .fail, requiredResources .gpu, progress reported to the system, expiration → the same checkpoint interruption). No software-CIContext background path unless IOS-01 proved it (V-N22). ActiveExportStore persists running job records, resumable checkpoints and `completedWhileDetached` records (with the output exempt from the work/ wipe for 7 days), so activeJobs() reattaches, reports resumable or a one-shot interrupted after process death, and reports a completion that happened while no Dart listener was attached; when such a completion happens with `whenDetached = saveToGallery` and add-only Photos access is authorized, the PhotosSaver saves natively. PhotosSaver: PHPhotoLibrary add-only PHAssetCreationRequest (NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription; denied -> permissionDenied). FileHandoff: UIDocumentPickerViewController(forExporting:asCopy:true) and UIActivityViewController.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** on a **real iPhone on iOS 18 and on iOS 26** (lab), backgrounding an export for > 30 s and returning resumes from the last segment and the result passes conformance with continuous barcodes (V-N20); on the simulator the checkpoint/resume logic is tested with an injected writer failure (−11847) since the simulator does not reproduce encoder loss; iPad continued task with progress on device when entitled (V-N12 with INT-03); resumable after kill; completedWhileDetached reported once; Photos add-only works without full library access; Files and share sheets return results; temp file left for Dart to delete via OwnedFileDeleter.

#### AND-12 · Android export foreground service, notification, background guard, MediaStore, file handoff

- **Milestone:** M5 · **Area:** Android native

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/android/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/vecvel/vwish/editor/engine/service/`
- **Spec:** D-22: ExportService foreground service (type mediaProcessing on API 35+, dataSync on 29-34) started by the coordinator, notification with determinate progress <= 1 Hz and a Cancel action that works with the activity destroyed, API 35 onTimeout -> interrupted, POST_NOTIFICATIONS requested in context by Dart (no notification -> export still runs visibly); BackgroundGuard leases hosted by the same service (used by auto captions on Android). MediaStoreSaver: MediaStore.Video with RELATIVE_PATH Movies/Vwish and IS_PENDING; FileHandoff: SAF ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT and ACTION_SEND via FileProvider ${applicationId}.vwish.editor.files. **Detached completion (D-39):** when a job completes and no Dart listener is attached (activity destroyed, app swiped from recents, engine gone), ExportService applies the job's whenDetached handoff natively (default saveToGallery via MediaStoreSaver), writes a completedWhileDetached record to ActiveExportStore, exempts the output from the work/ wipe, and posts a 'Saved to Gallery' notification that opens the app.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** export continues with the activity destroyed; **swiping the app from recents mid-export ends with the video in the Gallery and a completedWhileDetached record offered once on relaunch** (instrumented with UiAutomator plus the QA-02 shell script); notification Cancel cancels; FGS types correct per API (29, 34, 35 emulators); lease lifecycle; gallery insert visible in the Photos app; share intent grants read permission only to the chosen target.

VAD, host huggingface.co / hf.co, sha256) — the ONLY place UserConsent.accepted( is called; resumable download progress; phases extract/transcribe/segment with ETA; cancel at every step leaves no partial track; result applied as ONE history entry via EditorController.apply; failure copy for every TranscriptionFailure). Hidden unless VWISH_AUTO_CAPTIONS is true and offers() is non-empty.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** widget tests with FakeTranscriptionService for every state and failure; architecture test for the consent call site passes; cancel leaves the project unchanged; one undo removes all generated cues; no Material chrome; matrix tests.

- **Spec:** ARCH §14.1, ux.md §11, D-23/D-24: pre-checks (missing media -> relink sheet; pending reverse/freeze -> wait or cancel; empty timeline; free space vs estimate; first-export background notice; Android 13+ notification permission in context), presets (YouTube, YouTube 4K, Shorts, Reels, Instagram Feed, TikTok) and custom settings gated by capabilities (resolution, fps Match project (default) or 24/25/30/48/50/60, container MP4/MOV*, codec H.264/H.265*, quality, video and audio bitrate), aspect-mismatch notice, size estimate, burn-in per subtitle track and SRT/VTT side files, sprite pre-pass ('Preparing') via API-04 SpritePrepass, compileExport, preflight warnings, start; non-dismissible progress with phase/ETA/backgrounded copy per BackgroundExportKind (iPhone `paused`: 'Keep Vwish open while exporting. If you leave, the export pauses and continues from where it stopped when you come back.'; Android: 'You can leave Vwish; you'll get a notification when it's done.'; iPad `continued`: system progress), cancel with confirm (deletes partial), completion (Save to Photos/Gallery default, Files, Share, 'Keep a copy in Vwish' to Documents/Exports **only through core DocumentsExportWriter** (D-44), Play in Vwish), temp file deletion via OwnedFileDeleter, failure fallbacks (Export with H.264, Lower resolution, free space), reattach via activeJobs: running → progress, resumable → 'Resume export', interrupted → one-shot notice, completedWhileDetached → one-shot 'Your export finished' card with Share / Save to Files / Delete ('Saved to Gallery' shown when it was saved natively; D-39). Editing is blocked while exporting.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** widget tests with fakes for every pre-check, preset, gating, warning, progress state (incl. pausedInBackground copy), cancel, completion destination, resume, completed-while-detached card and failure; Custom fps list incl. 48 and Match project; 'Keep a copy' with a pre-existing Documents/Exports file of the same name leaves it untouched and creates '<name> (2).mp4'; temp file deleted; matrix tests.

PlayerController handoff extension: suspend(pause | release on lowMemoryDevice) and resumeAfterEditor (restore paused at the original position). EditorLauncher.openFromPlayer: pause -> File.exists + engine.compatibility (<= 300 ms; platform copy e.g. iOS MKV) -> repository.findUntouchedProjectFor(path) or create(fromMedia, initialPlayhead: position) ('Preparing editor…' after 300 ms; managed copies such as the Android 'open with' cache go through UX-06's ImportMediaSheet flow with a free-space preflight (size + 64 MB), copy progress and Cancel) -> PlayerHandoff.suspend -> open the editor through a navigation callback supplied by the router (INT-04 pushes /editor/:id?t=<µs>) -> when that route pops, resumeAfterEditor and orientation restore.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** widget tests: visibility rules (local vs stream, platform, controls locked → hidden), E shortcut (ignored while locked), cheat-sheet line present only with the callback, unsupported dialog copy per platform and per device reason, untouched-project reuse, exact position passed, managed-copy cancel deletes the partial copy and free-space refusal shows copy, return restores paused + orientation; top bar **and the Playback more sheet's 'Edit video' row** have no overflow at 280 px @1.35; existing player tests pass unchanged.

  - `docs/editor/release-checklist.md`
  - `docs/editor/user-guide.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/editor/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Spec:** [INTEGRATION] ARCH §23 release checklist: version 1.1.0+3; release builds pass --dart-define=VWISH_EDITOR=true --dart-define=VWISH_AUTO_CAPTIONS=true on iOS and Android (desktop builds keep the editor hidden); Android release workflow runs scripts/ci/editor/check_native_libs.sh on the AAB; iOS fastlane builds the whisper xcframework before `flutter build ipa`; store metadata (descriptions mention video editing and on-device Auto captions with the one-time model download; release notes; screenshots via existing fastlane lanes; privacy labels unchanged; **publish the updated privacy policy and terms generated from legal_texts.dart at every store privacy URL** — iOS/macOS `privacy_url.txt` target https://vecvel.com/ios/vwish/privacy and the Play listing URL — with a diff or screenshot as evidence; iOS release lane runs check_ios_min_os.sh; Play FGS declaration text for dataSync 29-34 / mediaProcessing 35+; App Review note that the model is data, not code, V-A14); docs/editor/release-checklist.md (filled ARCH §23 with links to every QA report), docs/editor/user-guide.md (features and shortcuts), README architecture section; final ARCHITECTURE.md status updates (§24.2 closures only).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** every ARCH §23 item checked with evidence (incl. the hosted-policy diff and the D-43 sign-offs); release workflows dry-run green; App Store Connect validation and Play pre-launch report clean; tag-ready main.

#### CORE-35 · Core benchmarks, large-project fixture, README

- **Milestone:** M6 · **Area:** Core (pure Dart)
- **Depends on:** CORE-26, CORE-32, CORE-34, CORE-33
- **Owns:**
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/benchmark/`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/projects/large_2000.json`
  - `packages/vwish_editor_core/README.md`
- **Spec:** benchmark/run.dart measures every core row of ARCH §18.2 (apply/dryRun at 1,000 items, incremental compile + diff at 2,000, full compile + encode, open at 2,000, autosave block) in AOT on the CI host with a JSON baseline; `--check` fails on > 25% regression (wired by core.sh). large_2000.json: 2,000 items, 32 lanes, 3 h, 300 media, 3,000 cues. README: package boundaries, command-authoring checklist (purity, rejections as data, validator, fuzz registration), schema/migration procedure, plan versioning rules (ARCH §11.9).
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** all core budgets met on the CI host (and recorded for one mid-tier Android and one iPhone through QA-04); regression gate active in dart-core; README reviewed.

  - `packages/vwish_editor/test/timeline/tiles/`
- **Spec:** Only if QA-04 shows a timeline UI/raster budget miss (ARCH §18.2 remedy order): picture-tile cache for RenderTimelineCanvas (tiles keyed by lane, zoom bucket and content stamps from Track.changedAt; invalidation on edits, zoom, thumbnails/waveform arrival), integrated behind a flag read by the canvas. If QA-04 passes, close as 'not needed' with the QA-04 numbers attached.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** when built: scroll/follow UI-thread time within budget on the low-tier device; invalidation tests; visual parity with direct painting (golden diff 0).

#### QA-00 · Shared on-device E2E suite (integration_test/editor)

- **Milestone:** M6 · **Area:** QA
- **Depends on:** INT-04, ENG-05, UX-05, UX-06, UX-11, UX-17, UX-20, UX-21, UX-23, UX-24, UX-25, UX-26, UX-27, UX-28, UX-29, UX-30, UX-32, UX-34, UX-35, UX-36, UX-38, UX-39, UX-40, UX-41, UX-42, IOS-13, IOS-14, IOS-15, IOS-16, AND-12, AND-13, AND-14, AND-15
- **Owns:**
  - `integration_test/editor/`
  - `docs/editor/qa/README.md`
- **Spec:** ARCH §21.2 scenarios 1-18 as integration_test files running against the real app wiring with ENG-05 fixtures copied to the app sandbox and the tiny model pre-staged through ModelStore.installFromFile (no network): (1) Home edit button left of the gear opens Projects; (2) player -> Edit on frame_counter_1080p30.mp4 at 0:05:10 opens the editor with the playhead at 5 s + 10 frames and debugCaptureFrame barcode 160; (3) create/rename/duplicate/delete project; (4) split, trim, move with snap, ripple delete, undo/redo, copy/paste, duplicate; (5) text with animation, cue add/split/merge, SRT import and export round trip; (6) speed 2× and a ramp, reverse, freeze frame, cross dissolve, LUT import, chroma key, mask, keyframes; (7) export of a project built through the UI (typewriter text, one burned SRT track, one burn-in-off track, a LUT and a cross dissolve on frame_counter) at 720p H.264 MP4 verified with vwish_data MediaInspector (container, avc1, size, duration ±1 frame, AAC) and HEVC/MOV where capabilities allow, then frames pulled with the engine's freeze job: subtitle safe area differs from a burn-in-off export at each cue midpoint and is identical between cues, the burn-in-off track never appears, the typewriter glyph count increases across the in-animation, blended barcodes only inside [cut − d/2, cut + d/2), SRT/VTT side files parse back to the same cues; (8) auto captions with the tiny model on speech_10s.m4a (>= 1 cue, SRT parses back, one undo removes all); (9) recovery after app kill; (10) missing media + relink on a sandbox copy incl. Relink several; (11) background/foreground during playback (no black frame after 1 s); (12) hardware keyboard and pointer (Space/K, ←/→ barcode-checked frame step, Shift+←/→, S, Delete/Backspace, ⌘/Ctrl+Z, ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+Z, ⌘S inside a text field, ⌘C/⌘V/⌘D, Space after tapping a tool tile, wheel/Shift+wheel/⌘+wheel zoom, right-click menu, marquee); (13) voiceover: grant permission, record 3 s (simulator host mic / emulator virtual mic), WAV clip on a voice lane at playhead + latency, audible in export; (14) PiP video overlay moved, scaled and faded, then exported; (15) extract audio, then music with a fade-in; (16) add a marker and snap a clip to it; (17) ⌘X cut then paste; (18) close and reopen: timeline JSON, playhead and zoom equal. Background, foreground, kill and relaunch steps are driven by the e2e shell scripts (xcrun simctl / adb shell am, input keyevent) synchronized with the in-app test through a file handshake in the app sandbox; cross-app drags from Files/Photos are manual checklist steps with recorded evidence. Platform extras: Android FGS with activity destroyed, notification Cancel, swipe from recents mid-export → video in the Gallery + finished card on relaunch, interrupted record; iOS backgrounding mid-export → pausedInBackground then resume from the last segment with a conformant result; API 28 below-gate checks (QA-02). Helpers for gestures with the memory note: taps of 0.1 s, no parallel tap + screenshot. docs/editor/qa/README.md explains how to run.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** suite compiles and passes locally on one simulator and one emulator before handing to QA-01/QA-02; flaky steps have explicit waits on engine acks or handshake files, not sleeps.

#### QA-01 · Run and certify the E2E suite on the iOS Simulator

- **Milestone:** M6 · **Area:** QA

Simulator realities (no hardware HEVC, software H.264, meaningless performance, no BG GPU) are reported, not failed. Defects are filed against the owning ticket's files as FIX tickets; this ticket re-runs until green.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** report with every scenario passing on both simulators, the manual iPad-simulator drop step (Files and Photos into the editor) recorded with screenshots, V-U5 certified, and the iOS 15.8 / 16.7 device smoke results recorded.

  - `packages/vwish_editor_engine/example/integration_test/av_sync_test.dart`
  - `docs/editor/qa/QA-03-parity.md`
- **Spec:** ARCH §21.1 'Parity, accuracy, A/V sync' on simulator, emulator and the device lab: frame-counter barcode exact seeks 200/200 (also inside speed segments and after structural patches); **grid-cut case (D-35)**: cuts at frames k ≡ 1 and 2 (mod 3) at 24, 30, 48 and 60 fps (frame_counter variants), every frame of a 3 s window around each cut shows the expected barcode in exact-seek preview, in playback capture and in export, on both platforms; clap/flash sync <= 1 frame and <= 20 ms in export and <= 1 frame and <= 40 ms in preview after latency compensation (§12.7, V-N23) at 1×, 2× keep-pitch, 0.5× ramp and across a cross dissolve; render parity of device output (debugCaptureFrame and exported frames) vs the API-03 reference within ARCH §11.6 tolerance, and iOS vs Android, incl. the 8× scale-keyframed text case; reverse barcode strictly decreasing; freeze barcode exact; proxy PTS equal. (Export conformance, presets and audio measurements are QA-11.)
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** suite green on iOS simulator + Android emulator in CI (where meaningful) and on the device lab list (iPhone 7 iOS 15.8, iPhone 8 iOS 16.7, iPhone SE 2, iPhone 12, iPhone 15 Pro; 2–3 GB Android Go, 4 GB Android, Pixel 7a, Pixel 9/Galaxy S24, API 29 device); grid-cut case 100% on every device; report attached.

- **Spec:** ARCH §14.4 and §21.1 'Export conformance and audio' (review issues 6, 24, 26), split from QA-03 to keep both suites reviewable. (1) Conformance: container, avc1/hvc1, size, display orientation and rotation metadata, fps, frame count = duration × fps ± 1, AAC 48 kHz stereo, bitrate ±25%, hardware-encoder flag; fixtures include no audio, everything muted, everything soloed out and images/text only. (2) **Preset matrix**: every preset (YouTube 1080p, YouTube 4K where capabilities allow, YouTube Shorts 1080×1920, Instagram Reels 1080×1920, Instagram Feed 1080×1350, TikTok 1080×1920, Custom 48 fps) exported on the API 35 emulator, the iOS simulator and the low- and mid-tier lab devices; a refused portrait encoder size must take the landscape-plus-rotation retry or fail visibly with encoderSizeLimit — never silently. (3) **Audio**: (a) tone_1khz exported at 2× and 0.5× with keep-pitch on keeps the dominant FFT bin within ±2% of 1 kHz, with keep-pitch off it moves to 2 kHz / 500 Hz; (b) a 3-lane project (music at 40% with fade in and out, voice with volume keyframes, one muted lane, one soloed lane, a cross dissolve with audio) exported and compared per 20 ms window with the API-03 Dart reference mixer (RMS ±0.5 dB; muted and soloed-out lanes < −60 dBFS); (c) 200% vs 100% = +6.02 ± 0.1 dB; (d) speed-ramp seam click test (7-point ramp, keep pitch: no seam transient > −40 dBFS above the tone envelope); (e) preview PCM where capturable (iOS offline render of the AVPlayerItem mix; Android audio sink tap in debug builds) checked with the same reference.
- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** suite green on the iOS simulator and Android emulator in CI and on the low/mid lab devices; every preset row recorded with measured values; report attached.

- **Acceptance criteria and tests:** report with each check passing and the evidence attached.

## 7. Shared and integration file register

These are the only paths edited by more than one ticket. The order is mandatory (each later ticket depends on the earlier one).

| Path | Tickets, in order | What each edit does |
|---|---|---|
| `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` | INT-01 → INT-03 | deployment target 15.0 → entitlements file and Runner privacy manifest references |
| `lib/main.dart`, `lib/router/app_router.dart` | INT-02 → INT-04 | editor bootstrap, `/projects`, `/editor/:id`, `/settings/editor`, Home/Settings callbacks → transcription service, adapters, player `onEditVideo`, `/settings/licenses`, LicenseRegistry |
| `pubspec.yaml` (root) | INT-02 → INT-04 → INT-05 | add vwish_editor, vwish_editor_engine, integration_test → add vwish_transcription, vwish_whisper → version 1.1.0+3 |
| `packages/vwish_editor_engine/{pigeons/, lib/src/pigeon/, lib/src/mobile_editor_engine.dart, ios/Classes/Pigeon/, android/.../pigeon/}` | ENG-01 → ENG-06 | Pigeon surface and Dart engine → spike outcomes, then frozen |
| `packages/vwish_editor_engine/{ios/vwish_editor_engine.podspec, ios/Classes/VwishEditorEnginePlugin.swift, android/build.gradle.kts, android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml, android/.../VwishEditorEnginePlugin.kt}` | ENG-01 (minimal placeholders) → ENG-07 / ENG-08 → ENG-06 (podspec, Gradle) | plugin builds from M0 → real glue, flags and manifest → spike build settings, then frozen |
| `packages/vwish_editor_engine/{ios/Classes/Glue/, android/.../glue/, android/lint.xml}` | ENG-07 / ENG-08 → ENG-06 | glue and lint opt-ins → spike amendments, then frozen |
| `packages/vwish_editor_core/test/fixtures/vectors/frame_grid.json` | CORE-02 → ENG-06 | vectors → the measured `androidSeekMsRounding` field only |
| `docs/editor/ARCHITECTURE.md` | INT-01 → ENG-06 → INT-05 | D-43 owner sign-off status → spike results in §5/§12.5/§13/§14.2/§24.2 → release status and [VERIFY] closures |
| `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` | CORE-28 only | adds `android:dataExtractionRules` and `android:fullBackupContent` (no other edits) |
| `packages/vwish_ui_kit/lib/vwish_ui_kit.dart` | UI-01 only | export lines for the six new components |
| Placeholder files (§2) | skeleton ticket → owner ticket | owner replaces the placeholder |

Feature tickets in `vwish_features` touch disjoint files and add only optional parameters (`onOpenEditor` UX-03, `onOpenEditorSettings` UX-04, `onEditVideo` UX-41, `onOpenLicenses` UX-42), so the app keeps compiling before the integration tickets wire them.

## 8. Feature coverage (owner's list → tickets)

Every bullet of the owner's feature list, plus the entry points and product rules, maps to the tickets that implement it (core model/commands, UI, native engines) and, where relevant, the QA ticket that certifies it. "Desktop UX" bullets ship now on iPad/Android tablets with keyboards, mice and trackpads, and carry over unchanged to the later desktop engine (ARCH §25).

| Section | Feature | Tickets |
|---|---|---|
| Entry points | Edit icon button immediately left of the Home settings button | UX-03, INT-02, QA-00 |
| Entry points | Edit directly while playing a video (player Edit action at the current position) | UX-41, INT-04, QA-00 |
| Entry points | Desktop: entry points hidden or 'coming soon'; architecture ready for a desktop engine | UX-01, INT-02, INT-04, API-01 (hidden; D-17) |

## 9. Corrections and decisions made while sequencing

These were contradictions or ordering problems found while writing this plan; ARCHITECTURE.md was corrected in place (row D-34).

1. `MediaAccessPort`, `PickedMedia`, `MediaStat` and `MediaAccessFailure` live in `vwish_editor_core/lib/src/model/pool/` (CORE-04), not `store/`, because the engine API (API-01, M0) implements the port and CORE-27 lands in M2.
2. `ops/limits.dart` (concurrent decoder layers, item count, 24 h) belongs to the command framework (CORE-09) and runs after every command, instead of CORE-17, so structural commands (CORE-10) don't depend on track commands.
3. Keyframe data types (`model/keyframes/keyframe_data.dart`) are CORE-03, since `MediaClip` holds a `KeyframeSet`; the PropertyKey registry and evaluation stay CORE-05. CORE-04 (pool) precedes CORE-03 because `EditProject` holds the pool.
4. CORE-27 (media pool service) precedes CORE-25 (repository), because `create(fromMedia)` and `findUntouchedProjectFor` need import and fingerprinting.
5. `/settings/editor` and `/settings/licenses` are explicit routes reached through optional callbacks; `SettingsDestination` is unchanged, because a new enum value would break the router's exhaustive switch before the integration ticket lands.
6. The privacy-host consistency test lives at the app root (INT-04): only the app depends on both `vwish_features` and `vwish_transcription`.
7. Because `vwish_editor` depends on `vwish_transcription` → `vwish_whisper` (an FFI plugin), the app pulls the whisper plugin as soon as INT-02 adds `vwish_editor`; INT-02 therefore depends on the whisper native builds (AI-04, AI-05), and iOS builds run `tool/build_ios_xcframework.sh --if-missing` (ENG-09's `ios.sh`, INT-05's Fastfile).
8. The example app's `RunnerTests` target uses an Xcode synchronized folder (ENG-09) so native tickets add test files without editing a shared `project.pbxproj`.
9. Release workflows are edited only by INT-05; AI-04 ships `scripts/ci/editor/check_native_libs.sh` instead of editing `android-release.yml`. AI-05's Fastfile step moves to INT-05 for the same reason.
10. `.vlut` writing is pure Dart in core (CORE-21, D-07); native.md's ENG-06 "LUT normalizer" ticket doesn't exist. native.md's plan codec moved to core (CORE-29, D-02). native.md's own ENG-09/10/11/12 (not this plan's ENG-09) became QA-03, QA-04, INT-03 (+ ENG-08 manifests) and QA-05. ux.md UX-44/45/46/47 became QA-04, QA-00, INT-05 and INT-05. ai.md AI-15/16/17/18/19/20 became CORE-15, UX-37, UX-38, UX-42 (+UX-38), QA-06 and QA-07. domain.md DOM-34/35 became QA-10 and CORE-35.

## 10. [VERIFY] closure

Every unverified platform claim is assigned to the ticket whose acceptance criteria close it; the authoritative list with owners is ARCH §24.2. Spike tickets (IOS-01, AND-01) start on day 1 and answer the engine claims (V-N1…V-N25 as assigned) before ENG-06 freezes the Pigeon surface; ENG-06 records the answers in ARCHITECTURE.md.

## 11. Review resolutions (2026-10-08)

The architecture review raised 38 issues (1 blocker, 15 major, 22 minor). All were applied, some in a narrower or different form; the decisions are D-35 to D-44 in ARCHITECTURE.md. Nine tickets were added (ENG-07, ENG-08, ENG-09, CORE-36, IOS-17, IOS-18, AND-16 (conditional), AND-17, QA-11): 149 → 158.

**Contract decisions made explicit**

| Topic | Decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Frame grid and platform time (blocker) | Plans keep `timeOfFrame(k) = ceil(k·10⁶/fps)`. Every platform time maps to `k = frameIndexNearest(τ) = round(τ·fps/10⁶)` and is evaluated at `timeOfFrame(k)`. iOS hands AVFoundation `CMTime(k, gridFps)` for every grid time; Android anchors every sequence boundary at `P(k) = round(k·10⁶/fps)`; plans carry `canvas.gridFps`. Shared vectors cover floor, round and rational inputs; grid-cut fixture and barcode case at k ≡ 1, 2 (mod 3). | D-35, ARCH §5, §11.2–11.5; CORE-02, CORE-29, IOS-08/10/11, AND-08/10, QA-03 |
| Android preview | Paused edits never use `experimentalRedrawLastFrame`; `PausedFrameRenderer` (AND-17) draws them with our shaders; structural patches are debounced; Android structural budgets renegotiated (§13.4). Contingency on no-go is AND-16 (N ExoPlayers + our GL compositor), sized, with owner sign-off on its degradations before M1 ends. | D-36, ARCH §13.3–13.4 |
| Android sequences | Core packing (CORE-36) assigns `seq`; caps on concurrent decoders and on visual sequences (`maxVisualSequences`); effects exit early for gated frames. | D-14, ARCH §13.5 |
| iOS background export | Backgrounding is an interruption: segment-resumable export with checkpoints and passthrough concat (IOS-17); iPhone `paused`, iPad iOS 26 with background GPU `continued`; no software-CI path unless proven. Proxy/reverse jobs share the semantics. | D-22, ARCH §14.2, §15 |
| iOS gain > 0 dB | `MTAudioProcessingTap` applies the whole envelope (0–2) per sample; no `setVolumeRamp`; export clamps to [−1, 1]. | D-37, IOS-18 |
| No-audio export | iOS writes silent LPCM and never builds a mix output over zero tracks; Android clock band declares `trackTypes {VIDEO, AUDIO}`; deprecated force-track setters dropped. | D-38 |
| Export hand-off when detached | `whenDetached = saveToGallery` default, native save, persisted `completedWhileDetached` record, `work/` wipe exemption, one-shot card on next open; mirrored on iOS. | D-39 |
| Spike ordering | IOS-01 and AND-01 start on day 1 in spike hosts with no dependencies; ENG-01 split into ENG-01/07/08/09; ENG-06 freezes Pigeon only after the extended spikes report. | D-42, §4 |
| iOS 15/16 testing | Lab iPhone 7 (iOS 15.8) and iPhone 8 (iOS 16.7); `-Werror=unguarded-availability-new`; `check_ios_min_os.sh` in CI and release; CMake install step; no AC depends on iOS 15/16 simulators. | D-41 |

**Applied (issue → resolution)**

1 frame grid → D-35 (above). 2 Android redraw/rebuild → D-36, AND-17, AND-01 tests (a)–(c), budgets renegotiated. 3 decoder/GPU limits → `maxVisualSequences`, CORE-36 packing in core, early exit (AND-09), 6-lane sparse-PiP case (V-N25). 4 iOS background → D-22, IOS-17, IOS-01/IOS-13 real-iPhone tests on iOS 18 and 26, honest `backgroundKind` and UX-39 copy, R3. 5 iOS gain → D-37, IOS-18, +6.02 dB ACs (IOS-18, IOS-12, QA-11). 6 no-audio export → D-38, IOS-12/AND-11 fixtures. 7 detached completion → D-39, AND-12/IOS-13/ENG-04/UX-39, swipe-from-recents AC. 8 Android fallback → AND-16 sized contingency, degradations listed for owner sign-off (D-43e). 9 sequencing → spikes on day 1, ENG-01 split, freeze after spikes; QA-03 split into QA-03 + QA-11; AND-08 slimmed by CORE-36. 10 iOS 15/16 → D-41. 11 VT 17.4 keys → `#available` + pre-17.4 HEVC detection (IOS-02, ARCH §14.2). 12 missing deps/owners → IOS-12 → IOS-11, AND-11 → AND-08/AND-10, QA-00 → native platform tickets; ENG-09 pre-declares example plist keys; ENG-08 declares the Photo Picker `ModuleDependencies` entry; spacer generated at runtime by IOS-08 (no resource). 13 PHPicker lifetime → native `clonefile` into `work/picks/` (IOS-15, ARCH §9.1). 14 reverse resources → GOP chunks from the end, random-access reader, 420v, preflight and 10-min cap, restated memory AC (IOS-07, AND-07). 15 sprite scale → per-item max animated scale clamped to `min(maxTextureSize, 2× long side)`, `maxTextureSize` capability, LayerLook sizing, 8× parity fixture. 16 Android backup → whole editor and speech trees excluded (see rejected note), documented, `bmgr` check. 17 fixtures → committed CC0 MKV/WebM, semantic-equivalence AC (V-U6). 18 preview A/V latency → `targetTimestamp` compensation on iOS, measured/delayed audio on Android if possible, preview tolerance ≤ 1 frame and ≤ 40 ms (§12.7), V-N23. 19 version drift → `@OptIn(UnstableApi, ExperimentalApi)` + lint, `trackTypes`, whisper v1.9.5 review in AI-01. 20 weak devices → `minimal` tier (D-40). 21 high speed → auto proxies above 2×, Android `setFrameRate` cap, ramp-seam click test with crossfade fallback (IOS-18, QA-11). 22 drag/lifecycle testability → synthesized drop sessions/DragEvents in IOS-16/AND-15, manual cross-app steps, shell-driven background/kill. 23 keyboard/pointer → QA-00 scenario 12, UX-15 Shortcuts-override AC, V-U3/V-U4 in UX-07/UX-12, 'Desktop optimization' row restated. 24 audio measurement → tone fixtures (ENG-05), Dart reference mixer (API-03), QA-11 FFT/RMS/mute checks. 25 export content → QA-00 scenario 7 frame checks; QA-07 uses the same method; side files parse back. 26 presets → QA-11 preset matrix; portrait retry-or-fail-visibly rule (ARCH §14.1). 27 originals/Documents → `DocumentsExportWriter` (D-44, CORE-24), UX-39 AC, QA-10 Documents check, `excludeFromBackup` guard (ENG-03). 28 platform reach → owner sign-off rows (D-43), API 28 emulator run in QA-02, UX-41 unsupported-device AC. 29 desktop teaser → flag deleted, macOS-targeted absence tests (INT-02, INT-04). 30 privacy → reworded summary, platform qualifiers, `HttpOverrides` no-network-before-consent test (INT-04), hosted policy publication (INT-05). 31 UI rules → longer forbidden list, whole-identifier matching, features-file scan (INT-01), `expectOwnerUiRules` (UX-01). 32 player Edit → cheat-sheet line (UX-41 owns `vwish_settings_panel.dart`), more-sheet overflow AC (UX-41, QA-09), hidden while locked, managed-copy preflight + cancellable progress. 33 touch/pointer ACs → UX-18 and UX-12. 34 export fps → Match project + 24/25/30/48/50/60 (CORE-33, UX-39). 35 container paths → persistence rule (ARCH §8.2), CORE-22/CORE-25 tests, QA-10 reinstall check. 36 E2E coverage → QA-00 scenarios 13–18 and the manual iPad drop step in QA-01. 37 restore relink → "Relink several" (`autoMatch`, CORE-28, UX-40). 38 subtitle track shift → `ShiftCues` (CORE-15), "Shift all captions…" and "Select all on this lane" (UX-31).

**Rejected or narrowed (with reasons)**

- Issue 9, splitting UX-01, IOS-11 and AND-08 further: not split. UX-01 is mostly generated placeholders plus small harness code; IOS-11 is one cohesive session object whose parts can't be tested apart; AND-08 lost packing to CORE-36. §1 rule 2 lets owners split inside their own files.
- Issue 28, a pure-Dart MKV/WebM → MP4 remux ticket: not scheduled. It is new scope, so it is offered to the owner as an option in D-43(d); until then the R7 copy stays.
- Issue 5, option 2 (ramps ≤ 1 plus make-up gain): rejected. The tap applies the whole envelope, which is simpler and sample-exact.
- Issue 10, "confirm iOS 15/16 simulator runtimes can be installed": not relied on. Physical lab devices are used because Xcode 26.6 on the dev Mac offers iOS 18.2+ only.
- Issue 12, bundling the spacer as a podspec resource: rejected. It is generated at runtime, so the podspec resource list stays frozen.
- Issue 16, excluding only `projects/*/assets/recordings` and `stills`: not possible, because Android backup rules take no wildcards. The whole editor tree is excluded instead (projects are not in Android backups), with the owner's sign-off D-43(f). iOS keeps project bundles in backups.
- Issue 17, writing WebM with a Media3 muxer: rejected. Media3 has no Matroska/WebM writer for this purpose, so small CC0 samples are committed with their provenance.
- Issue 18, delaying audio on Android: only done if Media3's audio sink supports a presentation delay (V-N23). Otherwise the separate preview tolerance (≤ 40 ms) applies.
- Issue 20, a higher hard device floor: rejected in favour of the `minimal` tier, so the owner's reach is kept (issue 28). The hard floor is only Metal on iOS, and API 29 + GLES 3 + 2 GB RAM on Android.
- Issue 29, building the "coming to desktop" dialog: rejected. "Hidden" already satisfies owner decision 1, so the flag is deleted.
- Issue 30, platform-conditional legal text: rejected in favour of static "On iPhone, iPad and Android" qualifiers, which avoids platform logic in `legal_texts.dart`.
- Issue 4, the iOS 26 software-Core-Image background path: dropped unless IOS-01 proves the Metal CI kernels run on the CPU renderer at ≥ 0.2× real time (V-N22).
