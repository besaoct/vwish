// Encoded-fragment cache for incremental project encoding (ARCH §8.3, domain.md §9.5).
//
// The model is immutable and structurally shared: after a one-item edit, every other item, every
// other track and every pool asset is the *identical* object it was before. `FragmentCache` keeps
// the canonical JSON text of each encoded node in an `Expando` keyed by object identity, so the
// next encode re-serializes only the nodes that are new (the edited item, its track, the timeline
// root and the meta) and splices the cached text of everything else. Entries die with their nodes
// (Expandos hold keys weakly), so the cache needs no eviction.
