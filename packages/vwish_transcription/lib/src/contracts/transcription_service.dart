// The Auto captions service contract (ARCH §16, D-21; ai.md §8.1). Implemented by
// `TranscriptionServiceImpl` (AI-13) and `FakeTranscriptionService` (lib/testing.dart). The
// service never mutates the project: the editor applies results with the core commands
// `AddGeneratedCaptionTrack` / `ReplaceGeneratedCaptions` (CORE-15) as one history entry.
