# Third-party licences (vwish_whisper)

`vwish_whisper` ships the sources below inside this package (`third_party/whisper.cpp/`, a pruned copy of
whisper.cpp v1.9.4, commit `927cfce34f31707e17f2bff35c349632fb9e2c3a`; see `third_party/VENDORED.md`).
The licence texts are reproduced here so that binary distributions of the app can include them
(app-level "Open source licences" screen).

Speech models are **not** part of this package or of the app binary. They are downloaded on first use after
consent, each under its own licence, which the app shows next to the model.

## whisper.cpp and ggml (MIT)

Source: https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp (whisper.cpp, and the ggml tensor library it bundles under `ggml/`).
Both are covered by one licence file, `third_party/whisper.cpp/LICENSE`:
