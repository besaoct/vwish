// Token -> word assembly and UTF-8 safety (ai.md §4.6 "Word assembly").
//  * Raw token bytes are concatenated. A new word starts at a token that begins with ' ' and, for
//    no-space scripts (zh, ja, yue, th, lo, km, my, bo), after every token at which the accumulated bytes
//    end on a complete UTF-8 character.
//  * A word is emitted only once its bytes are valid UTF-8 (multi-byte characters often span BPE
//    tokens); a trailing incomplete or invalid sequence becomes U+FFFD.
//  * Pure-punctuation tokens attach to the previous word.
//  * t0/t1 are the min/max of the member token times, clamped to the segment and forced monotonic
//    (no overlaps); p is the minimum member token probability. Without token timestamps the segment span
//    is shared out by byte length.
